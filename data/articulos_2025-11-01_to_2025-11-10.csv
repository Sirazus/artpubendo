54b7fafd41f016f8161c1a21f9376988,Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models on External Cervical Resorption: A Comparative Study of Gemini and NotebookLM.,J Endod,2025 Nov 7:S0099-2399(25)00665-X,"Introduction: This study evaluated the accuracy and consistency of two large language models (LLMs) developed by Alphabet Inc., Google Gemini (GG), a base configuration, and NotebookLM (NLM), a document-grounded configuration, when answering clinical questions regarding external cervical resorption (ECR) using a retrieval-augmented framework. Methods: Forty-six dichotomous clinical questions related to ECR were developed by three academic endodontists based on established sources. Each question was submitted to GG and NLM using three independent user accounts, yielding 276 responses. The retrieval-augmented generation configuration was replicated by NLM, which was programmed to generate responses exclusively from the documents provided. Three endodontic experts independently evaluated all responses against predefined gold standard answers. Accuracy was defined as agreement with the gold standard; consistency referred to identical responses across the three trials. Statistical analyses included 95% confidence intervals (Wald and Wilson), Fleiss' kappa, and Fisher's exact test. Results: GG achieved an accuracy of 89% (41/46; 95% CI, 76.96-95.27) and a consistency rate of 93% (κ = 0.89; p < 0.001). NLM achieved an accuracy of 96% (44/46; 95% CI, 85.47-98.79) and the same consistency (κ = 0.90; p < 0.001). No significant differences occurred between the LLMs for accuracy and consistency. Conclusions: The NLM and GG models exhibited a high level of accuracy and consistency. Although NLM had a slightly superior performance, retrieval augmentation did not significantly enhance the responses to structured clinical tasks.",2025-11-10

Methods: One 3-dimensional-printed mandibular jaw model was created. The fiducial markers used for registration were prepared on the crowns of anterior and posterior teeth. The models were scanned using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), and digital models were built. Different numbers (three, four, six, eight, and ten), configurations (quadrilateral, triangular, and linear) and distribution ranges (target tooth, adjacent teeth, and mandibular dentition) of fiducial markers were applied for registration of the dynamic navigation system. The target registration error (TRE) was measured. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to assess registration error between groups. The significance level was set at .05. Results: The TREs of four markers were significantly lower than those of three for both anterior tooth (0.32 mm vs 0.62 mm; P < 0.05) and posterior tooth (0.22 mm vs 1.43 mm; P < 0.05); increasing the number of markers to ten did not further reduce the TREs (P > 0.05). The TREs of markers arranged in a quadrilateral configuration were significantly lower than those in linear and triangular configurations (P < 0.05). The TREs of the markers selected on the target tooth and adjacent teeth were significantly lower than those in the entire dentition region for anterior tooth (P < 0.05). Conclusions: In endodontic treatment, the best registration accuracy was obtained by selecting four spatial quadrilateral fiducial markers localized around the target tooth.",2025-11-10

Methodology: SCAP were isolated from immature third molars, and P. endodontalis was added to the cell culture medium. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed using the CCK8 assay and flow cytometry, with vascular endothelial cells (VECs) serving as a comparative group. Transmission electron microscopy was utilised to observe the mitochondrial morphology and bacterial ultrastructure. Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were assessed using laser scanning confocal microscopy. Additionally, the effects of mitophagy or mitochondrial fission inhibitors on SCAP cell viability and MMP were evaluated. Transcriptomic high-throughput sequencing was conducted to analyse differentially expressed mRNAs in SCAP and VECs after P. endodontalis infection using gene set enrichment analysis. Western blotting was performed to detect the expression of proteins associated with mitophagy and mitochondrial fission. The co-localisation of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 with translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane 20 (TOM20), as well as dynamin-related protein 1 with TOM20, was examined using laser scanning confocal microscopy. Data were analysed using SPSS 22.0, and a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Following 6 h of P. endodontalis infection, SCAP exhibited higher cell viability and lower cell apoptosis rates than VECs. In addition, SCAP maintained more stable mitochondrial morphology and higher MMP compared to VECs. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that differentially expressed mRNAs between infected SCAP and VECs were enriched in terms related to mitochondrial membrane, depolarisation and mitochondrial fission. P. endodontalis infection also upregulated the expression of proteins associated with mitophagy and mitochondrial fission in SCAP. Inhibition of either mitophagy or mitochondrial fission in SCAP decreased the viability of SCAP. Conclusions: SCAP could maintain cell viability after short-term P. endodontalis infection. The underlying mechanism may involve mitochondrial fission and mitophagy, which appear to function as key protective processes enabling SCAP to counteract infection-induced cellular damage. This study helps elucidate the molecular basis of SCAP survival under bacterial infection.",2025-11-10
7243db0ebb70c79a42b27db7a8db955b,Effects of Endodontic Perforations on Tooth Retention and Treatment Costs: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.,Int Endod J,2025 Nov 4,"Background: Perforations are complications that may occur during root canal treatment (RCT), requiring complex management if the tooth is to be retained. The influence of perforations and their management on long-term tooth retention and treatment costs remains unclear. Aim: Here, we evaluate endodontic perforations and resulting or alternative treatments for their cost-effectiveness. Materials & methods: A Markov model was developed to follow a molar with a perforation occurring during RCT in an initially 25-year-old patient. The perforation was either managed by repair or tooth extraction with subsequent implant placement. The absence of a perforation served as a control. Our health outcome was the retention time of the tooth or implant. Tooth or implant costs, as well as costs for treatments during follow-up were drawn from public and private fee item catalogues (BEMA and GOZ) in Germany. Costs were calculated in euros (EUR) in the year 2025 and discounted at an annual rate of 3%. Transition probabilities were drawn from systematic reviews. Results: The cumulative retention time after RCT without perforation was 52.9 years at cumulative lifetime costs of 2000.78 EUR. Perforation repair resulted in a longer retention time of 49.4 years but was also more costly (3485.94 EUR) compared to extraction and implant placement, which yielded a retention time of 44.0 years at a cost of 2813.46 EUR. In the first 13 years after treatment, perforation repair dominated extraction and implant placement, with lower costs and higher effectiveness, because initially perforation repair was less expensive. Conclusion: Perforation repair increases tooth retention time and comes with only limited or no additional costs depending on the age group. Perforations are associated with significant treatment needs and costs, and endodontic therapy should focus on avoiding them, likely justifying additional efforts if needed to do so.",2025-11-10
