af9d066cfa2e2d8d82eb8a80301cd9d2,Emergency Management of Permanent Tooth Avulsion: Comparative Performance of Dental Students and Artificial Intelligence Using a Multimodal Clinical Vignette Across Bloom's Taxonomy Domains.,International endodontic journal,2025,"To pioneer the first comprehensive benchmarking of dental students against 22 multimodal Artificial Intelligence (AI) models spanning six major architectures (Anthropic, DeepSeek, Google Gemini, OpenAI, Meta Llama, Mistral/Qwen) in emergency permanent tooth avulsion management, quantifying performance differences across Bloom's Taxonomy higher-order cognitive domains (Apply, Analyse, Evaluate) against International Association of Dental Traumatology (IADT) guidelines to optimise evidence-based educational integration. This cross-sectional study compared 35 fifth-year dental students with 22 multimodal AI models grouped by producer (Anthropic, DeepSeek, Google Gemini, OpenAI, Meta, Mistral/Qwen) using a validated clinical vignette featuring a 14-year-old with three avulsed mature permanent teeth (#11, 12, 22) with clinical photograph. Performance was assessed through four questions (1 Apply, 2 Analyse, 1 Evaluate) via an IADT-aligned rubric validated against paediatric dentistry standards. Responses were independently scored by two blinded evaluators. Subsequently, scores were compared using ANOVA with post hoc Tukey HSD, Kruskal-Wallis, and chi-square tests (SPSS v20, α = 0.05). Overall performance analysis revealed significant group differences (p = 0.012, partial η2 = 0.27). Only students achieved high-acceptability A-level performance (17.1%, χ2 = 39.27, p = 0.003), despite top AI models (Claude-Sonnet-3.7-Reasoning, DeepSeek-R1: 7.0/10) marginally exceeding student mean scores (6.5/10). Performance varied among AI systems, with students significantly outperforming Meta Llama models (mean difference = 3.50, p = 0.014), which showed exclusively not acceptable (D-level) performance. Students dominated Bloom's Analyse level (visual diagnosis: 100% tooth identification vs. 77.3% AI failure; age-specific management differentiation, p < 0.001), while AI excelled in Apply/Emergency steps (medical management: 81.8% perfect scores) and Evaluate/prosthetic contraindication reasoning (Anthropic: 0.92 ± 0.20 vs. students: 0.41 ± 0.33, p = 0.005). Critical AI deficiencies included tooth misidentification (77% of models), failure to mention follow-up schedules for immature replanted teeth (100%), and inappropriate intervention recommendations (40.9% suggested unsuitable options like resin-bonded bridges). For soft tissue management, only 23% of AI models addressed the need to suture gingival lacerations. AI's fundamental limitations in visual diagnosis, IADT misinterpretations, and inadequate clinical translation mandate strict positioning as a supplemental protocol accelerator-not an independent diagnostic tool. Educational integration requires: (1) Careful model selection and supervision for any visual triage applications; (2) Mandatory IADT verification; and (3) Preservation of human clinical reasoning as the irreplaceable cornerstone of permanent tooth avulsion management.",2025-11-13,,Sanaa N Al-Haj Ali,10.1111/iej.70060
454a56c1e3276f822f67db1ca85df3c3,Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models on External Cervical Resorption: A Comparative Study of Gemini and NotebookLM.,Journal of endodontics,2025,"This study evaluated the accuracy and consistency of two large language models (LLMs) developed by Alphabet Inc., Google Gemini (GG), a base configuration, and NotebookLM (NLM), a document-grounded configuration, when answering clinical questions regarding external cervical resorption (ECR) using a retrieval-augmented framework. Forty-six dichotomous clinical questions related to ECR were developed by three academic endodontists based on established sources. Each question was submitted to GG and NLM using three independent user accounts, yielding 276 responses. The retrieval-augmented generation configuration was replicated by NLM, which was programmed to generate responses exclusively from the documents provided. Three endodontic experts independently evaluated all responses against predefined gold standard answers. Accuracy was defined as agreement with the gold standard; consistency referred to identical responses across the three trials. Statistical analyses included 95% confidence intervals (Wald and Wilson), Fleiss' kappa, and Fisher's exact test. GG achieved an accuracy of 89% (41/46; 95% CI, 76.96-95.27) and a consistency rate of 93% (κ = 0.89; p < 0.001). NLM achieved an accuracy of 96% (44/46; 95% CI, 85.47-98.79) and the same consistency (κ = 0.90; p < 0.001). No significant differences occurred between the LLMs for accuracy and consistency. The NLM and GG models exhibited a high level of accuracy and consistency. Although NLM had a slightly superior performance, retrieval augmentation did not significantly enhance the responses to structured clinical tasks.",2025-11-13,,Marc Garcia-Font; Nicolás Dufey-Portilla; Fernando Durán-Sindreu; José Antonio González Sánchez; Gustavo Rodríguez Millán; Venkateshbabu Nagendrababu; Paul M H Dummer; Francesc Abella Sans,10.1016/j.joen.2025.10.016
f6fc0f0103d123ac7564fd36d3d7a176,Research on Registration Strategy for Guided Endodontics.,Journal of endodontics,2025,"The objective of this study was to evaluate which registration strategy (the number, configuration, and distribution range of fiducial markers) could obtain the optimal registration accuracy for guided root canal therapy. One 3-dimensional-printed mandibular jaw model was created. The fiducial markers used for registration were prepared on the crowns of anterior and posterior teeth. The models were scanned using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), and digital models were built. Different numbers (three, four, six, eight, and ten), configurations (quadrilateral, triangular, and linear) and distribution ranges (target tooth, adjacent teeth, and mandibular dentition) of fiducial markers were applied for registration of the dynamic navigation system. The target registration error (TRE) was measured. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to assess registration error between groups. The significance level was set at .05. The TREs of four markers were significantly lower than those of three for both anterior tooth (0.32 mm vs 0.62 mm; P < 0.05) and posterior tooth (0.22 mm vs 1.43 mm; P < 0.05); increasing the number of markers to ten did not further reduce the TREs (P > 0.05). The TREs of markers arranged in a quadrilateral configuration were significantly lower than those in linear and triangular configurations (P < 0.05). The TREs of the markers selected on the target tooth and adjacent teeth were significantly lower than those in the entire dentition region for anterior tooth (P < 0.05). In endodontic treatment, the best registration accuracy was obtained by selecting four spatial quadrilateral fiducial markers localized around the target tooth.",2025-11-13,,Chang Liu; Longfei Ma; Yaopeng Zhang; Yanmei Dong; Xudong Bao,10.1016/j.joen.2025.10.017
3e9193430ed1a2f6b25225ca3f521d16,Mitochondrial Function Is Required to Preserve Viability of Stem Cells From the Apical Papilla Following Porphyromonas endodontalis Infection.,International endodontic journal,2025,"To investigate the effects of Porphyromonas endodontalis on the viability of stem cells from the apical papilla (SCAP) and to explore the role of mitochondrial function in supporting SCAP survival. SCAP were isolated from immature third molars, and P. endodontalis was added to the cell culture medium. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed using the CCK8 assay and flow cytometry, with vascular endothelial cells (VECs) serving as a comparative group. Transmission electron microscopy was utilised to observe the mitochondrial morphology and bacterial ultrastructure. Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were assessed using laser scanning confocal microscopy. Additionally, the effects of mitophagy or mitochondrial fission inhibitors on SCAP cell viability and MMP were evaluated. Transcriptomic high-throughput sequencing was conducted to analyse differentially expressed mRNAs in SCAP and VECs after P. endodontalis infection using gene set enrichment analysis. Western blotting was performed to detect the expression of proteins associated with mitophagy and mitochondrial fission. The co-localisation of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 with translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane 20 (TOM20), as well as dynamin-related protein 1 with TOM20, was examined using laser scanning confocal microscopy. Data were analysed using SPSS 22.0, and a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Following 6 h of P. endodontalis infection, SCAP exhibited higher cell viability and lower cell apoptosis rates than VECs. In addition, SCAP maintained more stable mitochondrial morphology and higher MMP compared to VECs. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that differentially expressed mRNAs between infected SCAP and VECs were enriched in terms related to mitochondrial membrane, depolarisation and mitochondrial fission. P. endodontalis infection also upregulated the expression of proteins associated with mitophagy and mitochondrial fission in SCAP. Inhibition of either mitophagy or mitochondrial fission in SCAP decreased the viability of SCAP. SCAP could maintain cell viability after short-term P. endodontalis infection. The underlying mechanism may involve mitochondrial fission and mitophagy, which appear to function as key protective processes enabling SCAP to counteract infection-induced cellular damage. This study helps elucidate the molecular basis of SCAP survival under bacterial infection.",2025-11-13,,S Lei; J Li; X C Wang; S Yu; A C Wang; N Yang; M C Gao; X Chen,10.1111/iej.70058
36d1ae9f0f95f1b6ed585aa311af9480,Effects of Endodontic Perforations on Tooth Retention and Treatment Costs: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.,International endodontic journal,2025,"Perforations are complications that may occur during root canal treatment (RCT), requiring complex management if the tooth is to be retained. The influence of perforations and their management on long-term tooth retention and treatment costs remains unclear. Here, we evaluate endodontic perforations and resulting or alternative treatments for their cost-effectiveness. A Markov model was developed to follow a molar with a perforation occurring during RCT in an initially 25-year-old patient. The perforation was either managed by repair or tooth extraction with subsequent implant placement. The absence of a perforation served as a control. Our health outcome was the retention time of the tooth or implant. Tooth or implant costs, as well as costs for treatments during follow-up were drawn from public and private fee item catalogues (BEMA and GOZ) in Germany. Costs were calculated in euros (EUR) in the year 2025 and discounted at an annual rate of 3%. Transition probabilities were drawn from systematic reviews. The cumulative retention time after RCT without perforation was 52.9 years at cumulative lifetime costs of 2000.78 EUR. Perforation repair resulted in a longer retention time of 49.4 years but was also more costly (3485.94 EUR) compared to extraction and implant placement, which yielded a retention time of 44.0 years at a cost of 2813.46 EUR. In the first 13 years after treatment, perforation repair dominated extraction and implant placement, with lower costs and higher effectiveness, because initially perforation repair was less expensive. Perforation repair increases tooth retention time and comes with only limited or no additional costs depending on the age group. Perforations are associated with significant treatment needs and costs, and endodontic therapy should focus on avoiding them, likely justifying additional efforts if needed to do so.",2025-11-13,,Leander Benz; Wadim Leontiev; Falk Schwendicke; Elias Walter,10.1111/iej.70051
