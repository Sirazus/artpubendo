63c522e84f41e2ae303d9029ea3ccae9,Improved Root Canal Disinfection through Extended NaOCl Exposure and Renewal After Preparation Procedures.,Journal of endodontics,2025,"This study evaluated whether extending NaOCl contact time with periodic renewal after preparation enhances root canal disinfection compared with a standard continuous-irrigation protocol. Twenty-eight bovine incisors were contaminated with Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) for 28 days. Specimens were assigned to two experimental groups (n=10) and two controls (positive, n=4; negative, n=4). Experimental canals received either standard continuous irrigation (20 mL 1% NaOCl over 4 min) or an extended protocol, in which 5 mL 1% NaOCl was left in situ for 5 min and replenished over four cycles, with a total of 20 mL. All canals were subsequently irrigated with 6 mL 17% EDTA and 6 mL 1% NaOCl under ultrasonic activation, followed by NaOCl neutralization. Microbiological samples were collected at baseline (S1), after primary irrigation (S2), and after final irrigation/activation (S3) using paper points and Hedström file scrapings. Colony-forming units (CFU) were quantified on Mitis Salivarius agar. Statistics comparison was performed with Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests (α=0.05). Negative controls confirmed asepsis, and positive controls verified bacterial viability. Both irrigation protocols significantly reduced CFU counts at S2 and S3 compared with baseline (p<0.05). The extended protocol yielded lower CFU counts than standard irrigation at both post-irrigation time points (p<0.05). Overall bacterial reduction from baseline to final sampling (S1→S3) was significantly greater for the extended protocol (P=0.027), while intermediate reductions (S1→S2 or S2→S3) did not differ between groups (p>0.05). The extended protocol resulted in a significantly greater microbial reduction compared with standard continuous irrigation.",2025-12-01,,Emmanuel João Nogueira Leal da Silva; David Victor Ferreira da Silva; Graziela Dos Santos Massa; Bárbara de Paula Coelho; Luciana Moura Sassone; Marco Aurélio Versiani; Ana Flávia Almeida Barbosa,10.1016/j.joen.2025.11.023
