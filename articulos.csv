54b7fafd41f016f8161c1a21f9376988,Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models on External Cervical Resorption: A Comparative Study of Gemini and NotebookLM.,J Endod,2025 Nov 7:S0099-2399(25)00665-X,"Introduction: This study evaluated the accuracy and consistency of two large language models (LLMs) developed by Alphabet Inc., Google Gemini (GG), a base configuration, and NotebookLM (NLM), a document-grounded configuration, when answering clinical questions regarding external cervical resorption (ECR) using a retrieval-augmented framework. Methods: Forty-six dichotomous clinical questions related to ECR were developed by three academic endodontists based on established sources. Each question was submitted to GG and NLM using three independent user accounts, yielding 276 responses. The retrieval-augmented generation configuration was replicated by NLM, which was programmed to generate responses exclusively from the documents provided. Three endodontic experts independently evaluated all responses against predefined gold standard answers. Accuracy was defined as agreement with the gold standard; consistency referred to identical responses across the three trials. Statistical analyses included 95% confidence intervals (Wald and Wilson), Fleiss' kappa, and Fisher's exact test. Results: GG achieved an accuracy of 89% (41/46; 95% CI, 76.96-95.27) and a consistency rate of 93% (κ = 0.89; p < 0.001). NLM achieved an accuracy of 96% (44/46; 95% CI, 85.47-98.79) and the same consistency (κ = 0.90; p < 0.001). No significant differences occurred between the LLMs for accuracy and consistency. Conclusions: The NLM and GG models exhibited a high level of accuracy and consistency. Although NLM had a slightly superior performance, retrieval augmentation did not significantly enhance the responses to structured clinical tasks.",2025-11-10

Methods: One 3-dimensional-printed mandibular jaw model was created. The fiducial markers used for registration were prepared on the crowns of anterior and posterior teeth. The models were scanned using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), and digital models were built. Different numbers (three, four, six, eight, and ten), configurations (quadrilateral, triangular, and linear) and distribution ranges (target tooth, adjacent teeth, and mandibular dentition) of fiducial markers were applied for registration of the dynamic navigation system. The target registration error (TRE) was measured. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to assess registration error between groups. The significance level was set at .05. Results: The TREs of four markers were significantly lower than those of three for both anterior tooth (0.32 mm vs 0.62 mm; P < 0.05) and posterior tooth (0.22 mm vs 1.43 mm; P < 0.05); increasing the number of markers to ten did not further reduce the TREs (P > 0.05). The TREs of markers arranged in a quadrilateral configuration were significantly lower than those in linear and triangular configurations (P < 0.05). The TREs of the markers selected on the target tooth and adjacent teeth were significantly lower than those in the entire dentition region for anterior tooth (P < 0.05). Conclusions: In endodontic treatment, the best registration accuracy was obtained by selecting four spatial quadrilateral fiducial markers localized around the target tooth.",2025-11-10

Methodology: SCAP were isolated from immature third molars, and P. endodontalis was added to the cell culture medium. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed using the CCK8 assay and flow cytometry, with vascular endothelial cells (VECs) serving as a comparative group. Transmission electron microscopy was utilised to observe the mitochondrial morphology and bacterial ultrastructure. Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were assessed using laser scanning confocal microscopy. Additionally, the effects of mitophagy or mitochondrial fission inhibitors on SCAP cell viability and MMP were evaluated. Transcriptomic high-throughput sequencing was conducted to analyse differentially expressed mRNAs in SCAP and VECs after P. endodontalis infection using gene set enrichment analysis. Western blotting was performed to detect the expression of proteins associated with mitophagy and mitochondrial fission. The co-localisation of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 with translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane 20 (TOM20), as well as dynamin-related protein 1 with TOM20, was examined using laser scanning confocal microscopy. Data were analysed using SPSS 22.0, and a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Following 6 h of P. endodontalis infection, SCAP exhibited higher cell viability and lower cell apoptosis rates than VECs. In addition, SCAP maintained more stable mitochondrial morphology and higher MMP compared to VECs. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that differentially expressed mRNAs between infected SCAP and VECs were enriched in terms related to mitochondrial membrane, depolarisation and mitochondrial fission. P. endodontalis infection also upregulated the expression of proteins associated with mitophagy and mitochondrial fission in SCAP. Inhibition of either mitophagy or mitochondrial fission in SCAP decreased the viability of SCAP. Conclusions: SCAP could maintain cell viability after short-term P. endodontalis infection. The underlying mechanism may involve mitochondrial fission and mitophagy, which appear to function as key protective processes enabling SCAP to counteract infection-induced cellular damage. This study helps elucidate the molecular basis of SCAP survival under bacterial infection.",2025-11-10
7243db0ebb70c79a42b27db7a8db955b,Effects of Endodontic Perforations on Tooth Retention and Treatment Costs: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.,Int Endod J,2025 Nov 4,"Background: Perforations are complications that may occur during root canal treatment (RCT), requiring complex management if the tooth is to be retained. The influence of perforations and their management on long-term tooth retention and treatment costs remains unclear. Aim: Here, we evaluate endodontic perforations and resulting or alternative treatments for their cost-effectiveness. Materials & methods: A Markov model was developed to follow a molar with a perforation occurring during RCT in an initially 25-year-old patient. The perforation was either managed by repair or tooth extraction with subsequent implant placement. The absence of a perforation served as a control. Our health outcome was the retention time of the tooth or implant. Tooth or implant costs, as well as costs for treatments during follow-up were drawn from public and private fee item catalogues (BEMA and GOZ) in Germany. Costs were calculated in euros (EUR) in the year 2025 and discounted at an annual rate of 3%. Transition probabilities were drawn from systematic reviews. Results: The cumulative retention time after RCT without perforation was 52.9 years at cumulative lifetime costs of 2000.78 EUR. Perforation repair resulted in a longer retention time of 49.4 years but was also more costly (3485.94 EUR) compared to extraction and implant placement, which yielded a retention time of 44.0 years at a cost of 2813.46 EUR. In the first 13 years after treatment, perforation repair dominated extraction and implant placement, with lower costs and higher effectiveness, because initially perforation repair was less expensive. Conclusion: Perforation repair increases tooth retention time and comes with only limited or no additional costs depending on the age group. Perforations are associated with significant treatment needs and costs, and endodontic therapy should focus on avoiding them, likely justifying additional efforts if needed to do so.",2025-11-10

Methods: Files from ProTaper Ultimate (PTU), BlueShaper (BSH), and ZenFlex (ZFL) systems (n = 60) were divided into 3 groups based on autoclaving cycles (0, 3, and 7) (n = 20). In each group, the files were tested under torsional stress or dynamic cyclic fatigue (n = 10 each). The fractured fragments from both tests were examined using scanning electron microscopy. New files from each system were subjected to 0, 3, and 7 autoclaving cycles and tested using energy-dispersive spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Wilcoxon signed-rank test at a 5% significance level. Results: BSH exhibited the highest torsional strength and dynamic cyclic fatigue resistance, particularly after 3 and 7 autoclaving cycles, followed by PTU and ZFL. ZFL showed a higher distortion angle than PTU and BSH after 3 and 7 cycles. Autoclaving decreased torsional strength of BSH and increased the distortion angle of ZFL. BSH exhibited the highest austenite finish and martensite start temperatures, with minimal thermal degradation observed after autoclaving. Conclusions: BSH demonstrated the highest torsional strength, dynamic cyclic fatigue resistance, and phase transformation temperatures across all autoclaving cycles, followed by PTU and ZFL. Autoclaving reduced torsional strength of BSH and increased distortion angle of ZFL but did not affect the dynamic cyclic fatigue resistance, phase transformation, or elemental analysis of the other tested files.",2025-11-10

While early studies report encouraging outcomes, its comparative clinical effectiveness, long-term benefits, and cost-efficiency remain under investigation. This scoping review aims to systematically assess the available clinical and laboratory evidence on the GentleWave System in endodontics. Methods: This review was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines and was prospectively registered in the Open Science Framework. A comprehensive search of 5 electronic databases (Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed/MEDLINE, SciVerse Scopus, and Web of Science) was performed to identify clinical and in vitro studies evaluating the GentleWave System. Results: A total of 34 studies met the inclusion criteria, including 28 laboratory-based investigations (82.4%) and 6 clinical studies (17.6%). Clinical trials reported high periapical healing rates, exceeding 97% at 6- and 12-month follow-ups, and postoperative pain levels comparable to passive ultrasonic irrigation. However, recent prospective data indicate similar healing outcomes when compared to other advanced irrigation techniques. Laboratory studies consistently demonstrated significant performance in removing biofilm, smear layer, calcium hydroxide, and filling materials, while maintaining reduced apical pressure and minimal dentin erosion. Methodological variability and limited long-term clinical data remain key limitations. Conclusions: The GentleWave System shows potential as an adjunctive irrigation technology, particularly in anatomically complex cases. Overall, the evidence mapped in this scoping review appears low to moderate, reflecting the limited number of available clinical studies and their high risk of bias.",2025-11-10

The objective of this study was to provide updated national estimates on the prevalence of PA in the United States hospital-based emergency departments (EDs) for the years 2021-2022, and to analyze predictors of related hospital charges. Methods: The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample database was used for the years 2021-2022. All ED visits with a primary diagnosis of PA were selected for analysis of the frequency of visits, sociodemographic, and hospital-related data. A multivariable linear regression analysis model was used to identify predictor variables that influence ED and hospital charges. Results: During the years 2021 and 2022 in the United States, a total of 846,629 ED visits were attributed to a primary diagnosis of PA. The populations who frequented the ED for PA the most were more likely to be insured by Medicaid (44.2%) and reside in low-income areas (42.1%). The mean ED hospital charge was $2,585 per encounter. Age, sex, ethnicity, insurance status, household income levels, geographic location, hospital teaching status, and presence of comorbid conditions all had a significant impact on influencing hospital charges (P < .05). Conclusions: The study found that the frequency of visits for PA in the ED remains high, and the hospital ED charges have increased significantly despite similar outcomes compared to data from the past decade. Demographic, socioeconomic, hospital-related, and comorbid medical conditions were associated with hospital charges.",2025-11-10
cd65989cc36d5802b4c1c29e09877099,Accuracy of Robotic Root Canal Localization Using Optimized Point Cloud Registration Strategies: An In Vitro Study.,J Endod,2025 Oct 27:S0099-2399(25)00648-X,"Introduction: Traditional registration process of robotic root canal localization remains cumbersome. This study aimed to determine optimal point cloud registration strategies for robotic root canal localization and evaluate its accuracy. Methods: 3D-printed mandibular dental models were divided into point cloud group (PCG) and fiducial point group (FPG) based on registration method. Fiducial points and target points were prepared in FPG, while only target points were prepared in PCG. After CBCT imaging and intraoral scanning, registration was performed using respective methods, with PCG acquiring point clouds from different tooth surfaces. Registration accuracy was evaluated by calculating fiducial registration error (FRE) and target registration error (TRE). Then the robot system performed root canal localization in each group, measuring entry, apical and angular deviations. Statistics were analyzed using independent sample t-tests and one-way ANOVA. Results: PCG achieved lowest registration errors when lingual surface point clouds were acquired for anterior teeth and occlusal surface point clouds for posterior teeth (P < 0.05). Compared with FPG, the FRE of PCG was significantly lower (P < 0.05), while the TRE was comparable (P > 0.05). In PCG, the robotic system demonstrated entry, apical, and angular deviations of 0.25 ± 0.08 mm, 0.29 ± 0.06 mm, and 1.34 ± 0.81°, which was comparable to FPG (P > 0.05). Conclusions: The registration strategy utilizing point clouds from lingual surfaces of anterior teeth and occlusal surfaces of posterior teeth achieves high accuracy, feasible for robotic root canal localization. This method may enhance registration accuracy and clinical efficiency.",2025-11-10
88280111b723f83b50a700187ba9aae8,Artificial Intelligence Models for Diagnosing Pulpitis in Adults Using a Modified Wolters Classification: A Diagnostic Accuracy Study.,Int Endod J,2025 Oct 26,"Aim: To evaluate the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) system in diagnosing pulp conditions in adult patients, using a modified Wolters diagnostic classification. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted. Data from 200 teeth of 200 patients were collected. A clinical evaluation was performed, and a dataset containing 21 diagnostic attributes was compiled. A modified Wolters classification was used for more objective and reproducible diagnostic criteria. AI models (Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and XGBoost) were trained using a K-fold cross-validation approach. Hyperparameters were optimised, and model performance was assessed through precision, recall, F1-score and area under the receiver operating curves (AUCs). The final metrics were calculated over several iterations. To estimate model variability, bootstrap resampling was applied. Additionally, attribute importance was analysed using the permutation method. Results: The diagnoses were distributed in normal pulp (NP) (21.5%), initial pulpitis (IP) (13%), mild pulpitis (MIP) (21.5%), moderate pulpitis (MP) (25%) and severe pulpitis (SP) (19%). During validation, the models that achieved the highest performance were XGBoost (mean F1-score (0.85)) and SVM (mean F1-score (0.85)). Regarding ROC curve analysis, both models demonstrated AUC values exceeding 0.93 for all diagnostic classes. SVM reached perfect AUCs for SP and near-perfect values for NP (0.98), while XGBoost achieved a perfect AUC for NP and values above 0.90 for all other classes. Bootstrap analysis confirmed that XGBoost has the lowest variability and the best average values for precision (0.81), recall (0.81) and F1-score (0.80). On the other hand, pain to cold stimulus emerged as the most relevant attribute for diagnosis. Conclusions: The AI-based system demonstrated significant potential for achieving accurate pulp diagnoses, contributing to more objective diagnostic decisions. Pain intensity in response to thermal stimuli and spontaneous pain was a key feature that allowed correct classification, highlighting its relevance in the diagnostic process.",2025-11-10
42922ec53eeefae4e8b56ae691a1fb24,Influence of Engine-Driven NiTi Files on the Effectiveness and Technical Quality of Endodontic Treatment Performed by Undergraduate Students: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Int Endod J,2025 Oct 26,"Background: In recent years, many universities have incorporated engine-driven nickel-titanium (NiTi) instruments into their undergraduate endodontic programs, aiming to enhance the efficiency and precision of root canal treatments. While these techniques might offer advantages, concerns remain regarding their implementation, particularly in ensuring adequate training and supervision to prevent potential procedural errors that could compromise treatment outcomes. Objectives: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the quality of clinical root canal treatments performed by undergraduate students, comparing outcomes between the use of engine-driven NiTi files and stainless-steel hand files. Methods: The search was conducted across four electronic databases up to April 2025. The selection process adhered to the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes and Study (PICOS) criteria, including clinical studies evaluating the quality of root canal treatments performed by undergraduate students using engine-driven NiTi files versus stainless-steel hand files. Study quality was assessed using the Risk of Bias 2 (RoB-2) tool for randomised clinical studies and Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) for nonrandomized studies. Meta-analyses were performed to compare the prevalence of adequate root canal treatment quality, root canal filling quality, and procedural errors between the two techniques, using RevMan 5.3 software. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tool was applied to determine the overall certainty of evidence. Results: Ten studies were included, with most demonstrating a high risk of bias. Meta-analyses revealed that engine-driven NiTi root canal preparation with both rotary and reciprocating instruments resulted in significantly higher quality of root canal treatment, improving root canal filling quality, and reducing the incidence of ledge formation compared to stainless-steel hand files. However, no significant differences were found between the techniques regarding overfilling, perforations, apical transportation, or instrument separation. The certainty of evidence was rated as low. Conclusions: Engine-driven NiTi instruments improve the quality of root canal treatments performed by undergraduate students, particularly by enhancing filling quality and reducing ledge formation without increasing other iatrogenic risks. Nevertheless, these conclusions are based on evidence of low certainty. Trial registration: This systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42024600660).",2025-11-10
dca74ff020087dd2eb5a28b487e479aa,Efficacy of Post-Endodontic Access Cavity Cleaning Techniques: A Randomized Clinical Study.,J Endod,2025 Oct 22:S0099-2399(25)00640-5,"Introduction: This randomized clinical study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of different postendodontic access cavity cleaning techniques in removing residual epoxy resin-based sealer from the pulp chamber floor following root canal obturation. Methods: Seventy patients requiring root canal treatment in maxillary first molars were randomly assigned to 7 groups (n = 10) according to the cleaning protocol: dry cotton pellet, ethanol-saturated cotton pellet (5 seconds), ethanol-saturated cotton pellet (clinically acceptable cleanliness), ethanol-saturated cotton pellet + air polishing, ethanol-saturated microbrush (5 seconds), ethanol-saturated microbrush (clinically acceptable cleanliness) and air abrasion. After obturation with gutta-percha and AH Plus sealer, standardized macro photographs were taken before and after cleaning procedures. The sealer-covered area (SCA) was calculated using Adobe Photoshop based on pixel analysis. Statistical analyses included the Shapiro-Wilk, Paired samples t, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. A P value of <.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: All cleaning protocols significantly reduced SCA values compared to baseline (P < .05). The highest SCA reductions were observed in the air abrasion (96.1%), ethanol-saturated microbrush (clinically acceptable cleanliness) (93.9%), ethanol-saturated cotton pellet + air polishing (92.8%) groups, with no significant differences among them (P > .05). These groups showed significantly higher cleaning efficacy compared to the ethanol-saturated microbrush (5 seconds) (36.1%), dry cotton pellet (26.4%), and the ethanol-saturated cotton pellet (5 seconds) (17.7%) groups (P < .05). Conclusions: Among the evaluated methods, air abrasion, ethanol-saturated microbrush (clinically acceptable cleanliness), ethanol-saturated cotton pellet + air polishing and ethanol-saturated cotton pellet (clinically acceptable cleanliness) demonstrated superior effectiveness in removing residual sealer from the access cavity. Although no statistically significant differences were observed, application of microbrush and mechanically assisted cleaning techniques, including air polishing and air abrasion, emerged as the most reliable and effective cleaning strategies for clinical practice.",2025-11-10
065c728eae82bfad45a233b0787a8ef7,An In Vitro Investigation of the Impact of Ultrasound Induced-Streaming Motions on the Flow Inside Lateral Features of the Root Canal.,Int Endod J,2025 Oct 24,"Aim: The study aims to experimentally characterize the flow inside lateral canals during ultrasonic irrigation. The effect of the canal angle as well as the relative position of the endodontic file with the inlet of the channel was quantified. Methodology: An idealized endodontic geometry was 3D printed and used as a mould to fabricate a channel made of PEG-modified hydrophilic PDMS. The mould comprises a 20 mm tapered (6%) root canal with a 0.4 mm apical diameter and a 5 mm long lateral canal with a 200 μm square cross section, forming an angle of either 90° or 60° with the axis of the root canal and placed 6 mm from the apex. The channel was filled with a NaI-water solution and seeded with 1 μm particles. An ultrasonic instrument with a 15# K-file was employed for the irrigation. The flow field was characterized by Particle Image Velocimetry. Results: The flow inside the lateral canals is notably affected by the position of the endodontic file. There is a competition between the impingement of the ultrasound-induced jets on the walls of the root canal and the recirculation flows around the file, leading to either flow into the lateral canal or suction phenomena that generate backflow towards the root canal. Aligning the jet with the axis of the lateral canal maximizes the magnitude of the velocities that can be achieved therein. This alignment can only be achieved in the 90° channel. Inclining the lateral canal to 60° leads to lower velocities and a domination of the backflows towards the root canal. In both cases, a recirculation zone forms near the inlet of the channel where transverse velocities are comparable with the axial ones. The recirculation zone length is affected by the inclination of the channel. Further inside the canal, the flow becomes uniaxial. Conclusion: The flow during ultrasonic irrigation inside lateral features of the root canal is complex and considerably affected by the position of the endodontic file and the inclination of the channel. An optimum location of the file tip leads to maximization of the induced velocity inside the lateral canal, suggesting more effective cleaning.",2025-11-10
9d55025c6acd5798d4c361b55ffd11b3,"Intracellular Bacteria in Stem Cells of the Apical Papilla: A ""Trojan Horse"" for Regenerative Endodontic Failure.",J Endod,2025 Oct 21:S0099-2399(25)00642-9,"Introduction: Regenerative endodontic procedures show unpredictable outcomes in infected teeth due to persistent infection. While current disinfection protocols reduce but do not eliminate root canal bacteria, the fate of residual microorganisms during stem cell recruitment remains unclear. This study tested the hypothesis that endodontic pathogens invade and survive within stem cells of the apical papilla (SCAP), diminishing its biomineralization potential. Methods: Internalization of SCAP by Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Actinomyces naeslundii) and Gram-negative (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum) bacteria was characterized using colony-forming unit assays, confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Intracellular survival of E. faecalis was monitored for 14 days in both planktonic and biofilm phases. The impact of intracellular E. faecalis on SCAP biomineralization and odontogenic differentiation was assessed using alkaline phosphatase activity, alizarin red staining, and quantitative real-time PCR. Statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparison test or two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test. P < .05 was considered statistically significant. Results: All tested bacteria invaded SCAP with differential efficiencies. E. faecalis and F. nucleatum demonstrated robust internalization (∼5-log colony forming unit), while P. gingivalis and A. naeslundii showed reduced invasion (∼2.5 log colony forming unit). E. faecalis persisted intracellularly for up to 14 days, with biofilm-phase bacteria showing enhanced survival in monolayer SCAP cultures. Intracellular E. faecalis abrogated SCAP mineralization while maintaining cell viability, accompanied by significant downregulation of all tested odontogenic genes (P < .05). Conclusions: Bacteria invade and establish persistent intracellular infections within SCAP, creating protected reservoirs. These intracellular bacteria severely compromise odontogenic differentiation without killing the host cells, representing a potentially unrecognized mechanism of regenerative endodontic procedure failure. This ""Trojan horse"" strategy may explain the unpredictable outcomes of regenerative endodontics in infected teeth.",2025-11-10

This study evaluated the physicochemical properties (pH, surface tension, contact angle, available free chlorine), dentin penetration, and cytotoxicity of Triton, compared with 4% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) + etidronic acid (HEDP), 4% NaOCl/17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 4% NaOCl. Methods: pH was measured using a pH meter; surface tension and contact angle were assessed by the pendant drop and sessile drop methods, respectively. Available free chlorine was determined by titration with iodine/sodium thiosulfate. For dentin penetration, 39 extracted human premolars were instrumented, stained with crystal violet, irrigated, and analyzed under a stereomicroscope. Cytotoxicity was evaluated on L929 fibroblasts using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and neutral red (NR) assays. Results: Triton showed a pH of 12.49, available free chlorine of 4.18%, and significantly lower surface tension and contact angle than the other irrigants (P < .05). In the cervical third, Triton showed greater dentin penetration than 4% NaOCl and 4% NaOCl + HEDP (P < .05); in the middle third, greater penetration than 4% NaOCl (P < .05). No significant differences were observed in the apical third (P > .05). Triton and 4% NaOCl + HEDP groups had significantly lower cell viability compared to other groups (P < .05). Conclusions: Triton demonstrated an alkaline pH, lower surface tension and contact angle, and greater dentin penetration in the cervical and middle thirds compared to 4% NaOCl. However, its cytotoxicity, similar to that of 4% NaOCl + HEDP, emphasizes the need for safe irrigation dynamics to prevent periradicular tissue damage.",2025-11-10

f61a6a331f3c05b9d2dbf7e2e38275c8,The Use of a Novel 3D Printed Surgical Decompression Device to Induce Healing of Large Periapical Lesions: A Case Report.,Int Endod J,2025 Oct 17,"Aim: A case report to describe the use of a novel 3D printed surgical decompression device to induce healing of large periapical lesions. Summary: The development of periapical pathology is influenced by a variety of factors including local microbiology and pathophysiology. In large lesions, lone orthograde endodontic treatment is often insufficient in promoting healing of the periapical tissues and therefore is followed by apical surgery to reduce inflammation. While traditional surgical treatments often involve enucleation for cystic lesions, decompression techniques have shown to provide a less invasive alternative when combined with non-surgical and/or surgical endodontic treatment. The case presented here is a 21-year-old male with a large periapical lesion involving a root canal-treated right maxillary central incisor and nasopalatine canal; extending from the maxillary right lateral incisor to the maxillary left central incisor and having perforated buccal and lingual cortical plates. Clinically, the patient reported an associated fluctuant, non-tender buccal swelling. CBCT confirmed a well-condensed root canal filling; hence, it was decided to first treat the lesion conservatively using only the surgical decompression technique. Following a discussion about treatment options, the patient consented to surgical decompression. CBCT imaging alongside digital software was used to fabricate a customised decompression device that was sutured in situ for 4 weeks. Nine months following the removal of the device, CBCT showed evidence of osseous deposition, with a significant reduction of the periapical radiolucency and separation from the nasopalatine canal, thus portraying the use of decompression in its own right as a treatment option. Surgical decompression is not a novel technique, and the literature describes the use of various dental equipment such as suction tubing, needle hub, or dental dam material to facilitate decompression of a lesion. These devices have, however, shown to cause irritation, discomfort, and instability and are therefore not always effective in inducing healing. This case report describes the use of a novel digital workflow to fabricate a customised decompression device in the management of a large periapical lesion. The reduction of intra-cystic pressure alongside active irrigation reduced inflammatory compounds, contributing to a reduction in the lesion size and promoting osseous healing.",2025-11-10
d5d9bce01d182711ed65742bf6ad3ea0,Post-Traumatic Trigeminal Neuropathy Affecting an Accessory Canal of Canalis Sinuosus and Its Surgical Management: A Case Report.,Int Endod J,2025 Oct 16,"Aim: To describe an unusual case of post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathy affecting an accessory canal of the canalis sinuosus related to a maxillary central incisor. Summary: This case report presents a 48-year-old female patient who suffered from neuropathic pain following the crown placement and endodontic treatment of a left maxillary central incisor (tooth 21). A cone beam computed tomographic (CBCT) scan of the anterior maxilla revealed an accessory canal apical to tooth 21, with extruded sealer within the bony channel. A sustained resolution of the patient's symptoms was achieved following apicectomy of the tooth and surgical resection of the accessory canal. The tooth remained asymptomatic at the 5-year follow-up.",2025-11-10
e630804be762c3492e18ad6b616469d6,Dentine Integrity and Shaping Ability of 3 Single-File Systems in Flat-Shaped Canals.,Int Endod J,2025 Oct 16,"Aim: This study aimed to compare the shaping ability of 3 single-file systems in flat-shaped canals. Methodology: Thirty-six extracted mandibular incisors with flat-shaped canals were anatomically matched using micro-CT technology and assigned to three groups (n = 12) based on the single-file system used for root canal preparation: 1.5-mm SAF Infinitum, Reciproc Blue R25, or XP-endo Rise Shaper. After a new micro-CT scan, pre- and post-preparation datasets were co-registered and analysed to quantify changes in canal volume, surface area, unprepared canal areas, dentine thickness and hard-tissue debris volume. Parametric (One-way ANOVA, Student's t-test for repeated measures) and non-parametric (Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon Signed Rank) tests were applied for statistical comparisons (α = 5%). Results: All groups showed significant increases in canal volume and surface area and reductions in unprepared canal areas after each preparation step (p < 0.05), with no significant differences among SAF Infinitum, Reciproc Blue and XP-endo Rise Shaper in shaping parameters at any time point (p > 0.05). Dentine thickness significantly decreased over time in all groups (p < 0.001), except for Reciproc at the buccal pericervical region and lingual midroot (p > 0.05), with greater reductions in the lingual pericervical region (SAF Infinitum) and mesiodistal mid-root level (Reciproc Blue and XP-endo Rise Shaper) (p < 0.05). Critically thin dentine areas (< 0.5 mm) were only observed mesiodistally at the mid-root level after preparation. Hard-tissue debris volumes did not differ significantly among groups (p > 0.05). Conclusions: SAF Infinitum, Reciproc Blue and XP-endo Rise Shaper systems provide comparable shaping performance and dentine preservation in flat-shaped canals. While all systems cause some dentine thinning, critically thin areas remained limited and localised.",2025-11-10
0f29219f2b8d18bbae76dd68d5adc944,Restoration's Longevity in Endodontically Treated Teeth: A Machine Learning Survival Analysis From Randomised Clinical Trials.,Int Endod J,2025 Oct 15,"Aim: This prognostic study aims to develop a machine learning (ML) survival model for estimating the longevity (success and survival rate) of restorations in endodontically treated teeth (ETT). Methodology: Data were consolidated from four controlled clinical trials conducted in the Netherlands and Brazil, involving 424 patients and 618 restorations with up to 17 years of follow-up. The evaluated predictive models included Gradient Boosting Survival, Random Survival Forests and Survival Support Vector Machine. The dataset was split into 70% for training and 30% for testing. Hyperparameter tuning was optimised via 10-fold cross-validation with 50 iterations using hyperopt. Performance was assessed through the time-dependent area under the ROC curve (AUC), concordance index (C-index), inverse probability of censoring weights (IPCW C-index) and time-dependent Brier score. Results: The Gradient Boosting Survival model achieved the highest AUC mean (0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-0.78), C-index (0.80), IPCW C-index (0.78) and Brier score (0.06) for survival rate predictions, maintaining predictive stability over time. For success rate, the Random Survival Forest model outperformed others (AUC = 0.73, 95% CI [0.70-0.75]), C-index (0.66), IPCW C-index (0.64) and Brier score (0.14). SHAP analysis identified patient age and tooth type as having the highest variable importance for survival, while the dentist's experience was critical for success outcomes. Fairness analysis revealed performance disparities across sexes and countries in the models. Conclusions: The models demonstrated high predictive performance, mainly in survival rate prediction. ML models show promise for developing a robust, data-driven framework to evaluate success and survival outcomes in ETT.",2025-11-10
fbb5ee49163f2b006e961d0796290205,Migration of a Separated Endodontic File Into the Mandibular Canal: An 8-Year Follow-up Case Report.,J Endod,2025 Oct 13:S0099-2399(25)00607-7,"Separated endodontic instruments in mandibular molars may migrate into the mandibular canal, potentially causing neurological complications. The management of asymptomatic cases remains controversial. This case report presents the long-term conservative management of a separated stainless steel file that migrated into the mandibular canal. A 47-year-old male patient with chronic myeloid leukemia presented with a separated endodontic file that had migrated from the distal root of his mandibular right second molar into the mandibular canal over a 7-year period. Clinical examination, panoramic radiography, and cone-beam computed tomography were performed. Quantitative sensory testing using Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing and psychological assessment were conducted. Conservative management with periodic observation was selected due to the patient's asymptomatic status. Cone-beam computed tomography revealed the separated file extending 1.43 mm into a mandibular canal with a diameter of 2.54 mm. Despite radiographic evidence of neural canal involvement, the patient remained asymptomatic throughout the 7-year observation period. Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing detected minimal tactile sensitivity differences (0.1 g vs 0.55 g on the contralateral side), but no clinically significant neurological symptoms developed. Follow-up radiography at 8 years showed continued migration toward the inferior mandibular border without symptom development. Long-term migration of separated stainless steel endodontic files into the mandibular canal may remain asymptomatic. Adequate anatomical space within the mandibular canal, biocompatible properties of stainless steel, and patient-specific factors affecting sensory perception may contribute to the benign clinical course. Conservative management based on clinical symptomatology rather than radiographic findings alone appears appropriate in select asymptomatic cases, with regular monitoring recommended to detect potential delayed complications.",2025-11-10
578bbe96917fff92de151503f22115e8,Cemental Tear: Systematic Review and Thematic Analysis of Clinical and Imaging Features with a Proposed Diagnostic Framework.,J Endod,2025 Oct 13:S0099-2399(25)00639-9,"Introduction: Cemental tear (CT) is a rare condition with poorly understood prevalence, etiology, and clinical presentation, often mimicking vertical root fractures or endodontic-periodontal lesions. This review aimed to synthesize current evidence on CT and propose a diagnostic framework. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in Cochrane Library, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, and grey literature (Google Scholar, ProQuest) for case reports (2000-2024). Inclusion required full clinical and radiographic documentation. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist. Data on epidemiological, clinical, and imaging features were extracted. Results: Twenty studies reported 24 patients and 39 teeth. Methodological quality was heterogeneous, mostly with moderate risk of bias. CT mainly affected single-rooted teeth, especially incisors (46.1%), in older patients (mean 56.2 years). Frequent clinical findings included deep periodontal pockets (75%), mobility (60%), and fistulas (40%). Radiographically, bone loss (33.3%), radiopaque fragments (28.2%), and lateral radiolucencies (23.1%) were noted. Cone-beam computed tomography proved crucial for detecting buccal/lingual fragments. Histopathology confirmed cementum detachment, often infection-related. Treatments ranged from fragment removal to extraction, with prognosis linked to early diagnosis. Conclusions: CT is rare and challenging, best identified with high-resolution cone-beam computed tomography and integrated clinical evaluation. Early, precise diagnosis guides prognosis, with conservative fragment removal recommended when feasible.",2025-11-10
f1ba14bc8250ecdcac165f3cd4db6f10,The Clinical Impact of the Combination of CBCT and Periapical Radiographs on Endodontic Diagnosis and Treatment Planning-A Retrospective Cohort Study.,Int Endod J,2025 Oct 12,"Aim: To determine whether the combined use of periapical radiography (PR) and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) improves agreement among three endodontic experts compared with using either diagnostic tool alone. Methodology: Sixty clinical records with CBCT scans were selected from cases performed by postgraduate and master's students in endodontics at the University of Barcelona Dental Hospital. Three endodontic experts independently evaluated each case using a standardised questionnaire. Initially, they assessed the PR images. After 4 months, they reassessed the cases using CBCT. One year later, they reviewed both PR and CBCT together. Agreement levels were analysed for pulpal and periradicular diagnoses, treatment recommendations and aetiological assessments. Results: Inter-observer agreement improved across the study phases, peaking in phase 3-particularly for treatment recommendations. In this final phase, where both PR and CBCT were evaluated together, the agreement rate for pulpal diagnosis was 73.33%, with substantial reliability (κ = 0.67). Periradicular diagnosis showed a 40.00% agreement rate, with moderate inter-observer concordance (κ = 0.44). The lowest agreement was observed in the aetiology category (28.33%), with moderate concordance (κ = 0.50). Agreement on treatment recommendations reached 43.33% (κ = 0.51) and was the only category to show statistically significant differences between phases (p = 0.01). No significant differences were found for pulpal diagnosis (p = 0.39), periradicular diagnosis (p = 0.19) or aetiology (p = 0.36). Intra-observer agreement varied among experts, with some showing lower consistency in their responses when evaluating PR, CBCT and the combination of both, highlighting the influence of imaging modality on clinical decision-making. Conclusions: The combination of PR and CBCT improved inter-observer agreement across all categories compared to the use of a single imaging modality. However, this improvement reached statistical significance only for treatment recommendations. These findings suggest that, whereas combining PR and CBCT may support more consistent therapeutic decision-making, its impact on diagnostic agreement may vary depending on the specific diagnostic domain.",2025-11-10
0ecf85385f9c19863e379d57affb00cb,Effect of Restoration Strategy and Cavity Location on the Fracture Resistance of Teeth with External Cervical Resorption.,J Endod,2025 Oct 10:S0099-2399(25)00606-5,"Introduction: The restoration of external cervical resorption (ECR) defects requires materials capable of withstanding functional stresses. This study aimed to compare the fracture resistance of different restorative approaches applied to buccal versus palatal ECR defects under simulated clinical conditions. Methods: Eighty-one extracted human maxillary central incisors were used. Nine intact teeth served as the positive control group (n = 9). The remaining 72 teeth were randomly assigned to standardized buccal or palatal ECR defect groups (n = 36 each). Each subgroup (n = 9) received one of the following treatments: negative control (no restoration), Biodentine alone, Ribbond + Biodentine, or EverX Flow + Biodentine (n = 9 per subgroup). Standardized ECR cavities were created 4 mm apical to the cementoenamel junction, with dimensions of 3 mm in width and 3 mm in depth and connected to the pulp chamber. All specimens underwent chewing simulation (240,000 cycles, 50 N load) and thermocycling (5°C-55°C) prior to fracture testing. The fracture test was performed using a universal testing machine by applying force at a 45° angle, and the maximum load was recorded in Newtons (N). Statistical analysis was performed using parametric or nonparametric tests based on data distribution, with significance set at P < .05. Results: The restorative material significantly influenced fracture resistance (P < .05). In buccal defects, the Ribbond + Biodentine group demonstrated significantly higher fracture resistance compared to negative controls. For palatal defects, Biodentine alone showed significantly greater resistance than negative controls. No significant differences were observed between buccal and palatal locations (P > .05). Conclusions: While the choice of restorative material had a significant effect on the performance of restorations in ECR defects, the location of the cavity (buccal or palatal) did not significantly influence the outcomes.",2025-11-10
8dd57459f87b895d2fab9a02543fc266,The Impact of Training Dental Students to Use an Artificial Intelligence-Based Platform for Pulp Exposure Prediction Prior to Deep Caries Excavation: A Proof-of-Concept Randomised Controlled Trial.,Int Endod J,2025 Oct 10,"Aim: This study evaluated the effect of a short, personalised training session on student performance in using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based platform for pulp exposure prediction before caries excavation and determined the required sample size for a further randomised controlled trial (RCT). Methodology: Undergraduate dental students were randomly assigned to the experimental (training) group and the control (no training) group. The training group received a 1-h training session before undertaking the experiment, focusing on the uses, applications, and drawbacks of AI and carious lesion penetration depth. The theoretical presentation was followed by practical exercises and a quiz to check learning progress. Later, participants in both groups completed an experimental task involving 292 cases. They were asked to predict pulp exposure using an AI-based website. Sample size calculations determined the required sample size, with 80% power and an alpha of 5%. Results: 18 participants were enrolled (9 in each group). The agreement between participants' decisions and AI predictions regarding the presence or absence of pulp exposure (agreeableness with AI) was higher in the training group compared to the control group (0.83 vs. 0.76). The training group had a slightly higher mean F1-score (0.63 vs. 0.62), accuracy (0.69 vs. 0.68), and sensitivity (0.63 vs. 0.59) than the control group. Based on the sample size calculation, at least 31 participants per group are needed for the future RCT. Conclusions: The results support further investigation of customised training sessions prior to using an AI-based platform to assess their impact on dental students' agreement with AI predictions.

It investigated clinical practices, curriculum structure, competency assessment methods, and program challenges in order to provide insights into improving endodontic competency among dental school graduates. Methods: A comprehensive survey was electronically distributed to predoctoral program directors from accredited dental schools in the U.S. and Canada. The survey captured data on program characteristics, competency certification, and integration of advanced technologies. Data were evaluated and the significance level was set at P < .05. Results: Of the 87 program directors contacted, 48 responded (response rate: 58.54%). The survey revealed variability in clinical endodontic requirements, with a mean of 4.59 root canal treatments or 4.5 canals completed per student. Nearly one-third of schools reported insufficient patient pools, with 71.43% substituting simulation exercises for clinical experience. Most programs (86.05%) used extracted teeth for training, and 42.86% permitted students to treat routine second molars. Certification methods varied, with 29.27% emphasizing live patient experiences. Notably, 54.76% of directors were uncertain about their graduates' competence to perform molar endodontics in private practice. Conclusion: Endodontic education in the U.S. and Canada exhibits significant variability, with patient access being a key factor influencing training quality. Simulation exercises help mitigate some challenges, but their use raises concerns about the adequacy of clinical preparedness. Standardizing clinical requirements, improving patient access, and increasing integration of advanced resources could enhance educational outcomes.",2025-11-10
13f8e849e31403ed86dcd3cbdee5afe2,Accuracy of Robot-Guided Access Cavity Preparation in Managing Calcified Canals: An In Vitro Study.,Int Endod J,2025 Oct 10,"Aim: To evaluate the accuracy of guided access cavity preparation in calcified canals using a robotic system, compared to static and dynamic guided methods. Methodology: Three 3D-printed mandibular models presenting with pulp canal obliteration were allocated into three groups for robot, static and dynamic-guided access cavity preparations. The primary outcomes measured were the coronal deviation, apical deviation and angular deviation between the planned and actual paths of access cavity preparation. Additionally, all access cavities were confirmed to determine whether the canal was located. The data were analysed using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey's post hoc test and multilevel linear regression models. The significance level was set at 0.05. Results: All canals (n = 12) in the robot-guided and static-guided groups were located. In the dynamic guided group, a total of 10 out of 12 canals were found, with 2 resulting in root perforations. The accuracy of access cavity preparation using a robotic system showed no significant difference compared to the static-guided group (p > 0.05). However, the apical and angular deviation results were significantly lower in the robot-guided group than the dynamic-guided group (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The robotic system exhibited comparable accuracy to the static guide, whereas it significantly outperformed dynamic navigation in terms of guided access cavity preparation for calcified root canals. However, further clinical studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.",2025-11-10
44a41e8042d23cf5a03003169598c446,Evaluation of articaine infiltration location on the success rate of mandibular lateral incisor anesthesia: A prospective crossover randomized clinical trial study.,J Endod,2025 Oct 7:S0099-2399(25)00602-8,"Introduction: Effective anesthesia of the mandibular lateral incisor is challenging. This study compared the efficacy of lingual infiltration alone versus combined labial and lingual infiltration using 4% articaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine. Methods: In this prospective, randomized, crossover clinical trial, 50 healthy volunteers received two infiltration techniques: (1) lingual infiltration only (3.6 mL total via two 1.8 mL injections plus a mock buccal injection), and (2) combined labial and lingual infiltration (1.8 mL each; 3.6 mL total plus a mock lingual injection). Anesthetic success was evaluated by: 1) absence of response to maximal electronic pulp tester stimulation, 2) sustained anesthesia defined as no response within 16 minutes lasting 42 minutes, and 3) anesthesia onset time (first of two consecutive no-response readings). Pain during injection was assessed via the 170-mm Heft-Parker visual analog scale (VAS). Statistical tests included McNemar's, Wilcoxon signed-rank, Friedman, and Dunn's test. Results: The combined technique produced an equal or higher success rate (P ≤ 0.05), significantly greater sustained anesthesia (P < 0.05), and a significantly shorter onset time (P < 0.05) compared with lingual infiltration alone. Labial infiltration was associated with higher pain scores, especially during solution deposition (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The combination of labial and lingual infiltration with 4% articaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine significantly improves the anesthetic success and duration for the mandibular lateral incisor, although it is associated with increased injection-related pain.",2025-11-10

Methods: Sixty new endodontic files were subjected to cyclic fatigue resistance testing, which was performed in a CNC-milled stainless-steel artificial canal (60° curvature, 5 mm radius, 19 mm length; 1.4 mm inner diameter) submerged in a 32.0 °C water bath. Two samples were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry and Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence, while two fractured samples underwent scanning electron microscopy. Results: R Motion (RM) (2542 s) and Tia Premium Blue (TPB) (2419 s) exhibited significantly higher resistance to cyclic fatigue compared to Tia Viera Gold (283 s), W Plus Gold (318 s), and Wave One Gold (292 s). RM, Tia Viera Gold, and W Plus Gold had significantly longer fractured segments than TPB and Wave One Gold. Conclusions: Blue heat-treated files showed significantly higher cyclic fatigue resistance compared to gold-treated counterparts, with RM and TPB lasting over 2400 seconds, while others failed within 300 seconds.",2025-11-10

e38b58e622f8f9b7835b3937af4f4c89,Radial Lands and Alternating Cutting Edges Contribute to Reduced Screw-in and Torque in Curved Root Canals - An In Vitro Study.,J Endod,2025 Oct 7:S0099-2399(25)00601-6,"Introduction: This study aimed to evaluate screw-in force and torsional load generated by 6 fully rotating nickel-titanium (NiTi) file systems with different geometry, cross-section, and rotational speed. Methods: Ninety mesial roots of human lower molars were divided into 6 groups according to the file system used for canal preparation: F360, F6, TruNatomy, RACE EVO, JIZAI I, and JIZAI II. Groups were standardized balanced to working length, chord length, and canal curvature. A custom-built test rig with an attached endodontic motor (Schlumbohm EndoPilot 2) and a 6-axis measuring device were used to measure the apically directed, screw-in and torque forces generated along the axis of the tooth as the NiTi file was moved with an amplitude of 3 mm at each peck, increasing penetration depth by 2 mm at each peck. The rotary speed was set individually for each file according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two sets of 3 pecking motions were performed with intermitting cleanings of the file and needle irrigation of the root canal. Additionally, torque forces were recorded by the endodontic motor. Maximum force values for each set of pecks were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. The correlation between z-axis tooth torque and motor-measured torque was assessed using Spearman's correlation. Results: Significant differences existed between the files regarding apically directed, screw-in and torque forces (P < .05). Torque values generated on the tooth along the z-axis and torque on the file correlated significantly (P < .001). Conclusions: Radial lands or alternating cutting edges affect screw-in effect and torsional load of NiTi files.",2025-11-10
d436c732d08545bc1becd72b6dc4e169,A Thermosensitive Gel Containing Biodegradable Nanoparticles Carrying Calcium Hydroxide as Antibacterial Intracanal Therapy.,Int Endod J,2025 Oct 7,"Aim: To characterise and evaluate mucoadhesive strength and antibacterial properties of a nanotechnological formulation for endodontic disinfection based on biodegradable nanoparticles dispersed in a thermosensitive gel containing calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2-NPs-gel). Methodology: Morphology of Ca(OH)2-NPs-gel was studied using transmission electron microscopy. Moreover, Ca(OH)2-NPs-gel was sterilised using gamma irradiation (25 kGy), and the stability after the sterilisation process was studied by measuring Ca(OH)2-NPs-gel average size, polydispersity index, zeta potential and encapsulation efficiency. To assess the ex vivo mucoadhesive strength, extracted single-rooted human teeth were used to measure the force necessary to separate the formulation from the teeth. In addition, the short-time stability of Ca(OH)2-NPs-gel was evaluated monthly, analysing entrapment efficacy, backscattering and transmittance of Ca(OH)2-NPs-gel stored at different temperatures (4°C, 25°C and 37°C). Furthermore, the antibacterial analysis of Ca(OH)2-NPs-gel was performed against Enterococcus faecalis inoculated in extracted human single-root teeth and evaluated by confocal and scanning electron microscopy. Finally, the metabolic activity of bacteria was studied through a resazurin assay to evaluate bacterial survival after treatment. Results: Ca(OH)2-NPs-gel owned a round shape and a smooth surface without particle aggregation. Sterilisation did not induce an alteration in Ca(OH)2-NPs-gel physicochemical properties and Ca(OH)2-NPs-gel presented a high adhesion strength. In addition, 4°C was the best temperature to store Ca(OH)2-NPs-gel. Regarding the antibacterial therapeutic efficacy, Ca(OH)2-NPs-gel possesses suitable antibacterial properties, indicating that it efficiently reduces bacterial biofilms. Conclusion: Calcium hydroxide-loaded PLGA nanoparticles dispersed in a thermosensitive gel have been developed, optimised and characterised, obtaining excellent antibacterial properties and achieving bacterial disinfection levels similar to those of commercial formulations.",2025-11-10
50b0a1cf4654750d4df42ed4fa274e62,Surgical and Nonsurgical Endodontic Treatment of a Patient with Vitamin D-resistant Rickets and Extraoral Sinus Tract: A Case Report.,J Endod,2025 Oct 4:S0099-2399(25)00599-0,"Vitamin D-resistant rickets is a rare genetic disorder that significantly impacts oral health, causing characteristic dental manifestations including enlarged pulp chambers, spontaneous pulp necrosis, and frequent periapical infections. This case report describes the comprehensive endodontic management of a 32-year-old female with vitamin D-resistant rickets who presented with spontaneous pulp necrosis, periapical pathosis, and an extraoral sinus tract in multiple mandibular anterior teeth. Clinical examination, radiographic assessment, and vitality testing were performed. Initial nonsurgical root canal treatment was completed on teeth #22, #25, and #26, followed by aspiration. When no healing was observed at recall, surgical endodontic treatment with guided tissue regeneration was completed on teeth #24-26. Twelve-month post-treatment evaluation demonstrated complete symptom resolution, sinus tract closure, and radiographic evidence of osseous regeneration. Patients with vitamin D-resistant rickets present unique challenges for endodontic treatment due to impaired hard tissue mineralization and healing capacity. This case report demonstrates that adults with vitamin D-resistant rickets can achieve favorable endodontic outcomes, both surgically and nonsurgically.",2025-11-10
e51ccf485418be747a0df8077df55832,Assessment of Case Complexity of Root Canal Treatments Using Contemporary Complexity Grading Systems: A Clinical Service Evaluation.,Int Endod J,2025 Oct 6,"Aim: To assess the complexity of root canal treatments allocated to Postgraduate Endodontology trainees at Cardiff University Dental Hospital (CUDH) using the English Clinical Standards for Restorative Dentistry (ECS) in comparison with the Dental Practicality Index (DPI), the EndoApp (EA), and the Endodontic Complexity Assessment Tool (E-CAT). Material and methods: Two-hundred-and-one case records were evaluated by two calibrated examiners using each complexity assessment system. Inter-examiner and intra-examiner variability was calculated using Cohen's kappa coefficient. Statistical analyses compared the scores obtained for the same case using the different systems. Results: Most cases were assigned level 3 complexity using ECS, EA and E-CAT (82%, 92% and 74.1%, respectively), and scores of 3-5 (78.6%) using DPI. EA consistently assigned higher complexity scores compared with ECS and E-CAT. E-CAT assigned lower complexity scores compared with ECS. A statistically significant moderate-substantial level of agreement was demonstrated between E-CAT and ECS (weighted kappa = 0.647 [95% CI: 0.517 to 0.776], p < 0.001). A statistically significant fair level of agreement was demonstrated between EA and ECS (weighted kappa = 0.290 [95% CI: 0.113 to 0.466], p < 0.001) and EA and E-CAT (weighted kappa: 0.385 [95% CI: 0.226 to 0.544], p < 0.001). A statistically significant weak positive correlation was found between DPI and ECS [Spearman's correlation coefficient (rs) = 0.202, p = 0.004], DPI and EA (rs = 0.344, p < 0.001), and DPI and E-CAT (rs = 0.364, p < 0.001). The most common cause of increase in complexity scores was 'canal negotiability' for ECS (47%) and the 'endodontic treatment need' for DPI (84.1%). The unknown algorithm used by EA and E-CAT prevented the identification of specific factors that contributed to the endodontic treatment complexity. Conclusion: The majority of cases treated at CUDH were of high complexity. E-CAT assigned slightly lower complexity scores compared with ECS and EA, potentially due to its detailed assessment of factors. A weak positive correlation was found between the complexity grading systems. DPI's broader assessment justifies a cut-off score of 3 for specialist referral due to the increased agreement with ECS, E-CAT and EA at this threshold.",2025-11-10
af76494ea43a4c2518df91e3e6581171,From Cells to Animals: Connexin43 Suppression Enhances Autophagic Flux to Restore Odontogenesis in Inflamed Dental Pulp.,Int Endod J,2025 Oct 5,"Aim: Under certain conditions, infection-induced inflammation may activate reparative processes to form a hard tissue barrier against microbial invasion. Autophagy participates in odontogenic differentiation during inflammation in vitro, but its role in pulp repair remains unclear. This study investigated how autophagy regulated odontogenic differentiation within the inflammatory microenvironment, emphasising the regulatory role of connexin43 (Cx43) on autophagy. Methodology: Autophagy activation was detected in inflamed pulpal tissues using immunofluorescence (IF). Human dental pulp cells (hDPCs) were stimulated with 0.1/5 μg/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Autophagy dynamics, including autophagic flux, were analysed through western blotting (WB), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and mRFP-GFP-LC3 plasmid transfection. Odontogenic differentiation and mineralisation were assessed using molecular assays and Alizarin Red staining. Pharmacological inhibitors or activators were applied to determine autophagy's role. Cx43 knockdown in hDPCs and a dentine injury model in Cx43 cKO mice were used to validate their effects on autophagy. Results were analysed by two-way ANOVA. Results: Autophagy-related proteins were predominantly localised in the odontoblast layer. As dental pulp infection advanced, concurrent upregulation of LC3 and p62 levels was observed, indicating that autophagy activation occurs in the pulp alongside potential impairment of autophagic flux. 0.1 μg/mL LPS promoted autophagic flux, thereby facilitating odontogenic differentiation and mineralisation, whereas autophagy inhibition attenuated these effects. Conversely, 5 μg/mL LPS induced autophagosome accumulation but blocked autophagic flux, suppressing odontogenic differentiation and mineralisation; however, restoring autophagic flux reversed this inhibition. These data suggested that maintenance of autophagic flux integrity is essential for sustaining odontogenic differentiation capacity under inflammatory stress. Cx43 knockdown under high-inflammatory conditions rescued autophagic flux and improved differentiation. Similarly, in the dentine injury model of cKO mice, Cx43 deletion attenuated p62 expression while upregulating DSPP expression, accompanied by enhanced tertiary dentine formation beneath the injury site, indicating that blockade of Cx43 promotes autophagic flux to improve pulp repair. Conclusion: Autophagy regulates both inflammatory responses and repair processes in dental pulp. Specifically, maintaining functional autophagic flux ensures cells adapt to pathological stress while retaining their ability to form mineralised tissue. Cx43 inhibition promotes pulp repair through restoration of autophagic flux under inflammatory conditions, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for deep caries by synergistically modulating inflammation and promoting regeneration.",2025-11-10
a75791656744f0747b8593e8c5da9589,Viability of Dental Pulp Derived Stem Cells After Long-Term Cryopreservation.,J Endod,2025 Oct 3:S0099-2399(25)00597-7,"Introduction: Dental pulp-derived stem cells (DPSCs) have promise for use in regenerative therapies due to their regenerative and immunomodulatory potential. Following their isolation from dental pulp tissue, DPSCs can be cryopreserved and banked for future use, however, it remains unclear to what extent long-term storage affects their properties. This study evaluated the properties of DPSCs cryopreserved for up to 13 years. Methods: DPSCs from 12 patients cryopreserved for 5 (DPSC-5 YR), 10 (DPSC-10 YR), and 13 (DPSC-13 YR) years were analyzed for viability, immunophenotype (CD34, CD45, CD73, CD90, CD105), proliferation, and stemness. Additionally, senescence was evaluated through gene expression and senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. Results: All cryopreserved DPSCs showed high expression of stem cell markers CD73, CD90, and CD105 (>90%) with low expression of hematopoietic markers CD34 and CD45 (<4%). Proliferative capacity and proliferation rate demonstrated no significant differences in population doubling time among groups, with values of 1.32 ± 0.41 for DPSC-5 YR, 1.36 ± 0.44 for DPSC-10 YR, and 1.38 ± 0.53 for DPSC-13 YR, all comparable to DPSCs cryopreserved for less than 1 year (1.37 ± 0.57). Osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of DPSCs confirmed their ability to retain multipotency. Finally, senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining revealed an absence of senescent cells up to passage 6 and while stemness and senescence gene expression profiles varied, no significant differences were found in expression of these genes between DPSCs, regardless of numbers of years of cryopreservation. Conclusions: DPSCs can maintain viability, proliferative capacity, and stemness following long-term (up to 13 years) cryopreservation. These data support their long-term banking for clinical therapies aimed at tissue regeneration and immunomodulation.",2025-11-10
b0fb73733c6a6941bd9544b5711a8392,Unveiling the Vital Role of Dental Nerves in Dental Pulp Immune Defence and Repair.,Int Endod J,2025 Oct 4,"Background: Dental pulp sustains oral health through dentine formation, sensation, nutrition and defence. Beyond these classical roles, pulpal nerves have emerged as key coordinators of immune responses and tissue repair. While traditionally viewed as limited to sensory and vascular regulation, recent advances reveal that the nervous system interacts with immune mechanisms to manage inflammation and facilitate regeneration following injury or infection. Objectives: To synthesise evidence on the anatomy, distribution and functional diversity of dental pulp innervation, emphasising how nerves regulate innate/adaptive immunity and orchestrate pulp tissue repair and regeneration. Method: The review included studies up to the search period, utilising PubMed and Google Scholar. Search terms covered nervous-system concepts (""nerves"", ""neuropeptides"", ""nervefibres"", ""Schwann cells"") and immune/repair concepts (""immune response"", ""inflammation"", ""immune cells"", ""fibroblasts"", ""odontoblasts"", ""dental pulpstem cells"", ""dentine regeneration"", ""odontogenic differentiation""). Key termswere combined with Boolean operators: [nervous-system terms] AND [immune/repairterms] AND [dental], to capture studies on the role of dental nerves in pulpimmune defence and repair. Results: In innate immunity, dental nerves recognise pathogens, undergo sprouting in inflamed pulp, mediate neurogenic inflammation and engage in dynamic crosstalk with immune cells. In adaptive immunity, they influence antigen presentation and regulate T-cell activation through neuropeptides, highlighting their central role in immune modulation. Furthermore, dental nerves are indispensable for tissue repair, facilitating key processes such as progenitor cell recruitment, proliferation, differentiation and reparative dentine formation. Schwann cells and sensory and sympathetic innervation play distinct yet interconnected roles throughout these stages. Conclusion: The neuro-immune-endodontic axis is central to the pulp's ability to defend and repair itself, offering insights into innovative therapeutic strategies for managing dental pulp diseases. By integrating neural regulation into endodontic therapies, we can develop more effective treatments that leverage the complex interplay between the nervous and immune systems, enhancing outcomes for dental health and regeneration.",2025-11-10
211a03a28c5f35f96eeef6628d5063a8,Effects of Different Root Canal Sealers and Irrigation Agitation Methods on Postoperative Pain in the Treatment of Teeth with Chronic Apical Periodontitis: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,J Endod,2025 Oct 1:S0099-2399(25)00598-9,"Introduction: This study aimed to explore how different combinations of root canal sealers and irrigation activation techniques affect postoperative pain in single-rooted teeth with chronic apical periodontitis. Methods: Eighty teeth with single root and chronic apical periodontitis were randomly assigned into four groups according to the sealer and irrigation activation used: AH Plus sealer + manuel dynamic irrigation (MDI), AH Plus sealer + passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI), NeoSealer Flo + MDI, NeoSealer Flo + PUI. The canals were prepared using Reciproc (R25 and R40) files. Root canals were obturated with gutta-percha cones corresponding in size and taper to the final instrument used. Ah Plus was used in the first and second groups, and NeoSealer Flo was used in the third and fourth groups as the root canal sealer. The 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid used in the final irrigation was activated using two different agitation methods (MDI, PUI). Postoperative pain was assessed at multiple time points up to 7 days using the visual analog scale. Results: Pain intensity generally peaked between 6 and 24 hours after treatment. Among the groups, the AH Plus + MDI combination resulted in the lowest pain scores, while the NeoSealer Flo + PUI group showed higher pain levels. A significant difference was noted between early pain levels and the consumption of analgesics (P < .001). There were no statistically significant differences observed in terms of demographic characteristics (P > .05). Conclusions: The combination of MDI with the AH Plus showed lower levels of pain in the early postoperative period.",2025-11-10

Methods: The actual root canal length was measured using the visual method. The electronic canal length, which determined the apical foramen (AF), and the electronic working length, which determined the apical constriction (AC), were obtained using Raypex 6 and Root ZX II. The root working length, calculated by subtracting the AC-AF distance from the root canal length, served as a reference to evaluate the accuracy of the electronic working length. Anatomical parameters were derived from micro-CT scans and included Feret diameters of AC and AF, AC-AF distance, presence/absence of accessory canal, C-shaped type, AF position and AC morphology. Statistical analysis involved Fisher's exact test and multinomial logistic regression. Results: The study included 42 C-shaped molar teeth and 119 canals. Raypex 6 and Root ZX II determined AF within ±0.5 mm in 97.5% and 96.4% of canals, respectively. A statistically significant difference was found in accuracy between detecting AF and AC (P < .05). After multinomial logistic regression, multiple AC morphology was the only factor negatively affecting AC accuracy in both electronic apex locators. Conclusions: Raypex 6 and Root ZX II accurately detected AF but were less reliable for AC in C-shaped canal mandibular molars. Reduced AC accuracy was associated with multiple AC morphology, indicating that electronic apex locators may detect the first narrow part of the canal apically rather than the narrowest part.",2025-11-10
216904b9d23d8886cfd771efeb1ce69b,Uncertainty in Relation to Clinical Experience-A Qualitative Study on Dental Students' Reflections on Risk Assessment of Root Filled Teeth.,Int Endod J,2025 Oct 2,"Aim: In uncertain clinical situations, such as assessing the risk of exacerbation of apical periodontitis in root-filled teeth, undergraduate students can benefit from being trained to reflect. This study aimed to explore how students specifically reflected on clinical experiences in relation to uncertainty when assessing a case involving a root-filled tooth with apical periodontitis. Methodology: Short reflections were written by 52 dental students at Malmö University in 2021. All students were asked to reflect on the risk for exacerbation of apical periodontitis in a case with a root-filled tooth with a diffuse widening of the periodontal ligament space. The reflections were written according to prompts developed to stimulate reflection. For each student, the reflections were analysed by a qualitative method, Systematic Text Condensation (STC). Results: The analysis of the qualitative data resulted in the formulation of two themes about experience and lack of experience: Theme 1 'The meaning of clinical experience' and Theme 2 'Differences and similarities'. The themes were subdivided into nine subgroups and described the relationship between experience and certainty. Conclusions: The students believed that certainty comes with experience even when there is a lack of scientific evidence.",2025-11-10

a301c06220c3da3af43626bc57544171,Comparative Analysis of AI-Generated and Manually Designed Approaches in Accuracy and Design Time for Surgical Path Planning of Dynamic Navigation-Aided Endodontic Microsurgery: A Retrospective Study.,Int Endod J,2025 Oct 1,"Aim: To compare the accuracy and design time of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated and manually designed (MD) surgical pathways for osteotomies and root-end resections in dynamic navigation (DN)-aided endodontic microsurgery (EMS). Methodology: Fifty-one surgical pathways were analysed, each planned using both AI and MD methodologies. Accuracy was assessed using the DCARE Navigation System (v3.2, MedNav Ltd) and AutoCAD (2023, Autodesk Inc.), evaluating five parameters: start deviation, end deviation, angular deviation, root-end resection length deviation, and root-end resection angulation deviation. Design time was measured from the point of CBCT dataset import to the finalisation of the surgical pathway design. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the accuracy and design time of the AI and MD groups, whereas the rank-based ANCOVA was used to assess deviations according to tooth type, jaw type, and root number. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: Compared with the MD group, the AI group exhibited significantly smaller root-end resection length deviations (AI: 0.01 [0.01, 0.02] mm; MD: 0.02 [0.01, 0.03] mm; p = 0.029) but significantly larger root-end resection angulation deviations (AI: 3.48 [1.01, 7.48]; MD: 0.35 [0.16, 0.73]; p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the start deviation, end deviation, angular deviation, root-end resection length deviation, or root-end resection angulation deviation across tooth type, jaw type, or root number. The design time was significantly shorter in the AI group than in the MD group (55 [21, 74] s vs. 379 [215, 553] s; p < 0.001). Conclusions: A clinically operational AI-based surgical path design approach is capable of minimising manual interventions and delivering time-efficient, accurate results for clinical use. The integration of AI with DN-aided EMS may contribute to the development of increasingly autonomous surgical procedures.",2025-11-10

We hypothesized that patients would exhibit increased sensitivity to these stimuli. Methods: A controlled study was performed, including 50 MOP patients and 104 controls aged 18-65. Intraoral and extraoral sensitivities were assessed at various sites using simple quantitative sensory testing (numerical ratings of thermal/mechanical stimuli) and qualitative somatosensory testing (side-to-side differences in sensitivity to touch, cold and pinprick as hyper-, hypo- or normal). Pulp sensibility was evaluated using cold stimuli. Statistical analyses included repeated-measures analysis of variance and Fisher's exact test (α = 0.05). Results: Patients exhibited significantly higher intraoral hypersensitivity at the buccal gingiva to touch (14%), cold (34%), and pinprick stimuli (36%) compared to controls (0%, 14%, 15%). Similar trends were observed at extraoral sites including the masseter, temporalis, and thenar region. Pulp testing revealed significantly longer pain durations in patients (mean: 5.9 seconds) compared to controls (mean: 3.7 seconds), although pain intensity did not differ significantly. While simple quantitative sensory testing showed no significant group differences, qualitative somatosensory testing effectively identified intraoral and extraoral somatosensory abnormalities. Conclusions: Patients with MOP exhibited heightened intraoral sensitivity and prolonged pain responses. These findings underscore the diagnostic challenge of distinguishing sensitivity associated with MOP from odontogenic pain, such as pulpitis, which may lead to unnecessary dental procedures. Thorough assessments may help clinicians avoid misdiagnosis and improve outcomes, while longitudinal studies are needed to assess the possibility of clinical consequences.",2025-11-10
a496960dfda7cb8a65b44938dd69fad4,"Prevalence, Classification and Factors Associated With Cemental Tears-A Retrospective Observational Cross-Sectional Study in a Postgraduate Endodontic Clinic.",Int Endod J,2025 Sep 30,"Introduction: There is a lack of epidemiology studies on cemental tears. This study aimed to (i) investigate the prevalence of cemental tears among the patients referred to a Postgraduate Endodontic Clinic, (ii) classify the cases diagnosed with cemental tears, and (iii) assess factors associated with cemental tears. Materials and methods: This retrospective, cross-sectional study included 445 cases/teeth recruited between 1 September 2019 and 31 March 2024 at a University Postgraduate Endodontic Clinic. Information was collated from the clinical records of case history, clinical findings and radiographic interpretations from periapical radiograph (PR) and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images. For each case/tooth, cemental tear/s were categorised as either absent or present, and those with cemental tear/s were further classified. Thirty potential factors were studied, including patient-, jaw-, tooth-, previous endodontic treatment and periodontal-related factors. Factors were individually tested using univariate analysis with Pearson chi-squared (exact) tests. Any significant factors identified were further subjected to multiple logistic regression analyses based on a forward stepwise regression model (p < 0.05). Results: Cemental tear/s were found in 25 out of 445 cases/teeth, with a prevalence of 5.6%. Sensitivity and specificity of PR in detecting cemental tears were 0.6 and 1.0, respectively. Most cases/teeth detected were classified as Class 2 and 4 (n = 19, 76%) or Stage C and D (n = 19, 76%). Mean age of the subjects with cemental tears was 58.7 years, with comparable prevalence between males and females. Most cases (72%) with cemental tear/s had root canal treatment initiated or completed. Incisors, increased tooth mobility, severe crestal bone loss and adequate root filling quality were significantly associated with the higher prevalence of cemental tears (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Cemental tears should always be considered as a differential diagnosis in endodontic practice. Clinicians should be particularly vigilant for increased risks of cemental tears in incisors, mobile teeth, teeth exhibiting increased crestal bone loss and those with adequately filled root canals, as they may be misdiagnosed as periodontal-endodontic lesions. The use of CBCT is crucial for accurate diagnosis, guiding effective treatment planning and improving clinical outcomes in endodontic management.",2025-11-10

Methodology: In this double-arm parallel-group randomised clinical trial, 104 mandibular molars undergoing PP were randomised equally to either NaOCl lavage group (NL) (n = 52) or CHX lavage group (CL) (n = 52). The pulpal wound after pulp amputation during PP was irrigated with 3% NaOCl in the NL and 2% CHX in the CL group. After haemostasis, ProRoot Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (ProRoot MTA) was used as a pulpotomy agent. Patients were evaluated for pain experience at every 24 h for 7 days, clinical success at 3, 6 and 12 months, and radiographic success at 6 and 12 months. Data were analysed using Mann-Whitney U test to compare age, duration of haemostasis, pain score and analgesic consumption between groups and Chi-square test/Fisher's exact test to compare gender, the number of tooth surfaces involved by caries, hard tissue barrier, clinical and radiographic success, pain incidence and pulp sensibility responses. Results: Ninety-nine patients were assessed for clinical and radiographic success at 12 months follow-up. The NL group showed a higher success (91.8%) than the CL group (84%), albeit with no significant difference (p > 0.05). No significant difference was observed between the groups in postoperative pain experience (p > 0.05). Significantly less time was required to achieve haemostasis in NL (p < 0.001), and evidence of hard tissue barrier formation was significantly higher in the CL group (p = 0.024). Conclusion: Comparable success was observed following the use of the two lavage agents during PP in managing cariously exposed adult teeth with SIP. CHX can serve as a suitable alternative to NaOCl as a pulpal wound lavage agent. Trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT06240130.",2025-11-10

Methods: Standardized 0.5 mm-thick human dentin slices were prepared and exposed to various inorganic salt solutions under pH = 4, 7, and 10 conditions. Ion permeation was quantified over a 60-minute period. Morphologic changes were examined via scanning electron microscopy. ANOVA and Spearman's correlation were used to analyze the influence of multiple variables on the diffusion of ions. Results: pH values were found to be the most influential factor: ion permeation is significantly enhanced under acidic environments and is hindered under alkaline conditions. Molecular weight and ion charge also affected diffusion, with lower molecular weight and +1 charge ions showing superior permeation. No significant difference was observed between cations and anions. Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed no crystal deposition or tubule occlusion under the conditions investigated in this work. Conclusions: Ion permeation through dentinal tubules is primarily governed by environmental pH, followed by ion charge and molecular weight. These findings inform the rational design of ion-releasing dental materials tailored for acidic environments. Further research should explore long-term effects and multiion interactions to enhance clinical relevance.",2025-11-10
daaca2d9f3c699dd6a3715bdb664e20c,Outcome of High-Fidelity 3D Jaw Model Simulations in Enhancing Endodontic Microsurgical Training.,Int Endod J,2025 Sep 26,"Background: Endodontic microsurgery (EMS), indicated to manage teeth unresponsive to conventional root canal treatment, requires advanced technical expertise and clinical judgement. Traditional pre-clinical training methods lack fidelity and fail to replicate diseased states, leading to a steep learning curve clinically. High-fidelity 3D jaw model simulations offer a realistic and repeatable training solution, bridging the gap between theory and clinical practice. Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of high-fidelity 3D jaw model simulations in enhancing residents' confidence and preparedness for endodontic microsurgery. Methodology: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted involving second-year Endodontic residents enrolled in a postgraduate programme at the National University of Singapore. The intervention group (n = 11; 2021-2023 cohorts) participated in a structured four-session simulation training using high-fidelity 3D jaw models replicating anatomical details and periapical pathology. The curriculum incorporated diverse clinical scenarios, deliberate practice, and structured feedback. The control group (n = 4; 2020 cohort) attended a single-session workshop using pig mandibles. Pre- and post-workshop questionnaires were administered to assess self-reported confidence and preparedness using questions adapted from the Simulation Design Scale (SDS) and the Student Satisfaction and Self-Confidence in Learning (SSSCL) scale. Residents also completed a post-surgical evaluation after their first EMS procedure. Results: Residents trained with 3D models demonstrated greater improvements across all domains. Confidence in treatment planning improved from 2.45 ± 0.93 to 3.68 ± 0.69, compared to 3.75 ± 0.50 to 4.00 ± 0.00 in controls. Preparedness for EMS increased from 1.54 ± 0.82 to 3.20 ± 0.91 in the 3D group, and from 2.00 ± 0.82 to 2.75 ± 0.96 in the control group. Confidence in independently performing EMS rose from 1.27 ± 0.47 to 3.03 ± 0.95 in the 3D group, compared to 2.25 ± 0.82 to 3.00 ± 0.82 in the control group. The 3D group reported higher ratings for simulation realism, reduced stress, and greater perceived preparedness for clinical EMS. Conclusion: High-fidelity 3D jaw model simulations were effective in improving residents' confidence and preparedness for EMS. These findings support the integration of 3D simulation into Endodontic training to enhance clinical readiness and surgical competence.",2025-11-10

This study aimed to assess morphological changes in human apical papilla (AP) ex vivo, and to evaluate viability, proliferation, chemotaxis and osteogenic differentiation of human apical papilla cells (hAPCs) in vitro following exposure to Ca(OCl)2, in comparison to NaOCl. Methodology: Ex vivo, three AP samples per group were exposed to 1.5% Ca(OCl)2, 1.5% NaOCl or control solutions [17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and saline] for 3 min. The AP sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Masson's trichrome and Alcian Blue for morphological analysis. In vitro, hAPCs were exposed to Ca(OCl)2, NaOCl, EDTA or culture medium. Cell viability was assessed with the methyl-thiazole-tetrazolium (MTT) assay; proliferation by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation; chemotaxis by transwell assay; and mineralised nodule formation by alizarin red staining. Data were analysed by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test or by the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests (α = 0.05). Results: Ex vivo, marked loss of both cells and extracellular matrix components was observed in the outer layer of AP samples, particularly in the NaOCl and Ca(OCl)2 groups, with more severe damage found in the NaOCl samples. Samples treated with EDTA exhibited structural organisation similar to those treated with saline. In vitro, Ca(OCl)2 induced less cytotoxicity, resulted in the highest proliferation (p < 0.05), but promoted lower chemotaxis than the other irrigants (p < 0.05). EDTA and Ca(OCl)2 led to greater mineralised nodule formation than the other solutions (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Ca(OCl)2 at 1.5% caused less structural damage to AP than NaOCl at the same concentration and had a more favourable influence on the viability, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of hAPCs. Moreover, it did not impair cell chemotaxis. These findings suggest that Ca(OCl)2 may offer biological advantages in regenerative endodontic procedures.",2025-11-10

This bibliometric study aimed to identify and analyze the 100 most-cited articles related to root canal morphology to discover research trends, influential publications, and methodological progress in the field. Methods: Data were extracted from the Scopus database using the search terms ""root canal anatomy"" OR ""root canal morphology"" AND NOT ""Preparation,"" with selection finalized on July 28, 2025. Articles were manually screened, and only English-language original research related to human teeth was included. Citation counts, publication years, journal names, countries of origin, study designs, and methodologies were analyzed. Results: Most of the top-cited studies were published in the Journal of Endodontics and International Endodontic Journal, which together contributed 80% of the articles. Cone-beam computed tomography was the most used method, followed by dye-injected decalcified teeth and micro-computed tomography. The most frequently studied teeth were mandibular and maxillary first molars. Geographically, the United States, Brazil, and China led in publication output. Notably, there were no articles from Africa, highlighting a potential area for collaborative development. Over time, research has shifted from invasive in vitro techniques to advanced non-invasive imaging. The most-cited article was Vertucci's 1984 classification study, which remains widely used today. Conclusions: This bibliometric analysis delivers a comprehensive overview of influential studies in root canal anatomy, offering insights into global research patterns and technological advancement.",2025-11-10
37dc28a76a3a8f4adf537dbb25b68a42,Long-Term Biobanked Dental Pulp Stem Cells Retain Angiogenic Potential for Vascularised Tissue Engineering-Laboratory Investigation.,Int Endod J,2025 Sep 23,"Aim: This study aimed to evaluate whether human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), after long-term biobanking (7-8 years), retain their pro-angiogenic properties and can be used to engineer vascularised tissues, addressing their potential for clinical translation in regenerative dentistry. Methodology: Cryopreserved DPSCs from adolescent donors were recovered from biobanking and characterised for chromosomal integrity, MSC immunophenotype and multipotency. After conditioning in pro-angiogenic conditions in vitro, gene and protein expression were analysed by RT-qPCR array, flow cytometry and high-throughput immunophenotyping. Functional angiogenic capacity was assessed via in vitro tube formation, ex ovo CAM implantation assay, organ-on-chip perfusion model and long-term culture (45 days) in clinical-grade GelMA hydrogels, with and without HUVECs. Results: Biobanked DPSCs retained MSC identity and multi-lineage differentiation potential. Pro-angiogenic/endothelial conditioning enhanced the expression of angiogenic/endothelial genes (PECAM1, VEGFR2, NRP1, ACE), yet most cells maintained a pericyte-like phenotype. Both naive and endothelial-conditioned DPSCs (i.e., naiveDPSCs and endoDPSCs, respectively) significantly enhanced vascular ingrowth in the CAM model. In the organ-on-chip system, naiveDPSCs formed perfusable vasculature with HUVECs and differentiated into perivascular cell types. Most notably, endoDPSCs alone successfully generated vascularised tissue with both CD31(+) and αSMA(+) cells present in GelMA hydrogels after prolonged stimulation. Conclusion: Long-term biobanked DPSCs preserve their angiogenic potential and, following extended endothelial induction, can independently generate vascularised tissue in 3D in vitro culture models.

This study reports and investigates a unique case of extensive MIECR, potentially associated with chemotherapy exposure. The patient, a pharmacist responsible for preparing chemotherapy drugs, developed external cervical resorption affecting 13 teeth, with rapid progression occurring within just one year after starting her occupation. Notably, following local surgical treatment and cessation of high-risk work, the progression of MIECR was temporarily controlled. Methods: Whole-exome sequencing was conducted to identify potential genetic contributors. Granulation tissue removed from the tooth cavity, along with extracted teeth obtained during surgery, was collected for histopathological analysis to characterise the pathological features of MIECR. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on granulation tissue and healthy gingival tissue to explore the molecular basis of MIECR. Fibroblast-like cells were isolated from granulation tissue and subjected to in vitro experiments to validate their role in MIECR pathogenesis. Statistical analyses were conducted using Student's t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with a p-value of less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results: Whole-exome sequencing suggested a pivotal role for a GNAS missense mutation in disease pathogenesis. Histopathological analysis revealed extensive fibroblast proliferation and invasiveness within the lesion tissue. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing and in vitro experiments demonstrated abnormal fibroblast activity characterised by excessive proliferation and osteoclastic traits, implicating fibroblasts in MIECR progression. Importantly, the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway significantly reduced fibroblast invasion and osteoclastogenesis. Conclusions: This study offers novel insights into the pathogenesis of MIECR, paving the way for more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",2025-11-10

Methods: This systematic review was conducted following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, with the protocol prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251071354). Searches were performed in PubMed/MEDLINE and LILACS (via BVS) up to June 2025. Studies were eligible if they reported patient-level phenotypic, anatomical, psychological, or clinical features linked to PTTN following endodontic therapy. Three reviewers independently conducted data extraction and quality assessment. An exploratory meta-analysis was performed to estimate the pooled prevalence of PTTN by sex. Results: Nine studies were included. A predominance of female patients among those with PTTN was observed, with a pooled proportion of 67% (95% CI: 63.3%-70.5%). Psychological comorbidities such as anxiety and depression, previous chronic pain conditions, and endodontic procedures in anatomically high-risk areas particularly mandibular molars were also identified as potential risk factors. Some studies proposed predictive frameworks integrating sensory testing and patient history. However, heterogeneity in study designs and limited quantitative data prevented subgroup analyses. Conclusions: This review suggests that female sex, psychological vulnerability, and altered sensory modulation may be individual level-risk factors for PTTN following endodontic treatment. These findings reinforce the importance of risk-based clinical decision-making and underscore the need for prospective studies with standardized diagnostic criteria to develop validated predictive models in endodontics.",2025-11-10

27dc27fb545bbdf5c9df26172dc3338c,Modelling of the Systemic Inflammatory Host Response in Relation to the Microbiome of the Endodontic Infection.,Int Endod J,2025 Sep 18,"Aim: This study aimed to investigate systemic inflammatory responses in individuals with apical periodontitis (AP) compared to age-matched healthy controls, using advanced multiway modelling techniques. We examined associations between inflammatory mediators, age, gender, symptomatic status, and the microbial composition and function to better understand host-microbe interactions in AP. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal study with 53 participants (27 with AP, 26 controls) aged 18 to 80. Blood inflammatory mediators were measured at multiple time points. Root canal microbiome and potential functions were analysed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Data were analysed using Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) and Advanced Coupled Matrix and Tensor Factorization (ACMTF) to capture time-resolved variation. Results: PARAFAC revealed that IL-4 levels were significantly elevated in AP cases, suggesting a role for adaptive immune activation. Age strongly influenced markers such as CRP, TNF-α, and VEGF. Symptomatic AP cases showed higher CRP and lower OPG levels, indicating more active inflammation and altered bone metabolism. ACMTF identified associations between specific taxa (e.g., Parvimonas micra, Streptococcus mutans) and inflammatory mediators, with functional analysis highlighting enriched pathways like sphingolipid signalling in asymptomatic cases. Conclusion: This study provides novel insights into the systemic immune profile of individuals with AP. IL-4 and bone metabolism markers may serve as potential biomarkers for distinguishing AP status. Our findings support the relevance of systemic inflammation in endodontic infections and underscore the value of multi-marker, multivariate approaches to better characterise disease progression and host-microbiome interactions. Such insights could contribute to improved risk stratification and personalised management in dental and systemic health contexts.",2025-11-10
d4a785a1d458f051459f3b758c9c5825,Yerba Mate (Ilex paraguariensis A. St.-Hil.) Reduces Oxidative Stress and Bone Resorption in Apical Periodontitis.,Int Endod J,2025 Sep 16,"Aim: Apical periodontitis (AP) is a highly prevalent chronic inflammatory disease that can exert systemic effects by releasing biochemical mediators that initiate and regulate the immune response. Yerba Mate (Ilex paraguariensis, YM), a popular plant broadly consumed in South America, is rich in biologically active compounds known for their therapeutic potential. This study assessed Y's in vitro cytocompatibility, anti-osteoclastogenic and immunomodulatory effects on oral stem cells and macrophages, as well as its in vivo potential to reduce AP severity and systemic side effects. Methodology: In vitro, instant powdered YM was dissolved in distilled water, filtered and diluted in culture media to final concentrations ranging from 1 to 200 μg/mL. Cell viability and pro-inflammatory cytokine release (IL-1α, IL-6, TNF-α) were assessed in human exfoliated deciduous teeth stem cells. The NF-κB pathway and anti-osteoclastogenic activity were evaluated using a luciferase reporter assay and TRAP staining in RAW 264.7. Forty male Wistar rats were divided into control (C), YM-treated(YM), AP-induced (AP) and AP with YM treatment (AP + YM). YM treatment (20 Mg/Kg/Day) was administered via gavage for 58 days. AP was induced after 28 days of YM intake, and the animals were euthanised 30 days later. In serum, systemic redox state was assessed via total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Histological and immunohistochemical analyses evaluated inflammation, cytokine expression (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-17) and bone resorption markers. Micro-CT quantified alveolar bone loss. Data were analysed at p < 0.05. Results: YM treatment demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and bone-protective effects. In vitro, YM-supported cell viability, reduced TNF-α and IL-1α, inhibited NF-κB activation and suppressed osteoclastogenesis. In vivo, YM treatment restored systemic antioxidant capacity and reduced lipid peroxidation, mitigating AP-induced oxidative stress. Furthermore, YM intake attenuated the local inflammatory response and reduced the bone resorptive activity associated with AP. Conclusion: In vitro, YM suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines and NF-κB, inhibited osteoclastogenesis and was cytocompatible. In vivo, it reversed AP-induced redox state and reduced inflammation and bone resorption, suggesting therapeutic promise.",2025-11-10

Such teeth, when adequately restored and endodontically treated, present a clinical dilemma regarding whether to intervene or follow-up. The aim of this study was to examine dentists' clinical decision-making for well-treated endodontically and adequately restored teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis, presenting various sizes of simulated apical radiolucencies. Materials and methods: Twenty dentists (10 endodontic specialists and 10 prosthodontic specialists) completed a questionnaire containing cases of well-treated asymptomatic teeth, that is, adequately restored and endodontically treated, where some teeth showed normal apical tissues and others presented various sizes of simulated periapical radiolucencies (3 mm, 6 mm, 9 mm, or 12 mm). For each case, participants selected one of 4 treatment options: follow-up, root canal retreatment, endodontic surgery, or extraction. Results: Both specialty groups unanimously recommended follow-up for teeth without apical radiolucency. When apical radiolucency was present, its size was significantly associated with an active treatment decision, in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Among those who opted for treatment, endodontic surgery was the most frequently selected option, followed by retreatment, while extraction was the least chosen. Conclusions: This study suggests that dentists' decision-making regarding asymptomatic, adequately treated teeth with apical periodontitis is influenced by the size of the apical radiolucency. Moreover, there was a general tendency to preserve such teeth and to prefer endodontic surgery over orthograde root canal retreatment.",2025-11-10

The bone lid technique offers enhanced surgical access while minimizing bone loss. This case series reports on patients with intact buccal cortical bone thicker than 1 mm, treated surgically using the bone lid technique. Bone lids were created with a piezotome, preserved in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution, and repositioned after root-end surgery using a collagen matrix for stabilization. Healing was assessed using three-dimensional cone beam computed tomography criteria and evaluation of the bone lid integration perimeter. Out of 6 cases, 2 showed complete healing without complications. One case demonstrated limited cortical plate healing, and in two cases, the bone lids became dislodged, necessitating further intervention. These findings indicate that the bone lid technique in endodontic microsurgery may support favorable cortical healing when postoperative stability is maintained. Bone lid integrity appears to be a critical factor in successful outcomes.",2025-11-10

Methodology: Vertucci type II and Yin type IV mesial root canals from 24 extracted mandibular first molars were randomly divided into two groups (n = 12): (1) C-HA conditioned and (2) control (deionised water). All canals underwent standardised preparation using ProTaper Next files with 3% NaOCl irrigation (2 mL per file change) and final irrigation with 17% EDTA (5 mL, sonic activation) followed by 3% NaOCl (5 mL) and a final deionised water rinse (5 mL). Before obturation, the C-HA group received 5 min of C-HA solution (2 mg/mL) treatment with active agitation by ProTaper Next X2 gutta-percha cone, while the control group received equivalent water treatment. Canals were obturated using the single-cone technique with Ceraseal. High-resolution Micro-CT (8.6 μm voxel size) quantified void percentages in the entire canal system and isthmus regions, with analysis stratified by coronal, middle and apical thirds. Selected specimens underwent SEM evaluation of interfacial adaptation. Statistical analysis used the independent samples t-test, two-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc tests (α = 0.05), and Fisher's exact test. Results: No significant differences related to the canal/isthmus pre-treatment volumes and isthmus characteristics were noted between the two groups. Micro-CT analysis revealed significantly lower void percentages in C-HA-treated canals compared to controls (9.21% vs. 19.01% in the entire canal system and 19.07% vs. 55.65% in the isthmus regions, p < 0.001). Analysis of the void distribution patterns further demonstrated statistically significant differences between the groups in the cervical and middle root thirds (p < 0.05). SEM evaluation showed continuous, gap-free interfaces with bioactive mineralization in C-HA-treated canals, contrasting with discontinuous adaptation and sparse precipitates in controls. Conclusion: C-HA dentine conditioning significantly improved obturation quality with Ceraseal bioceramic sealer by reducing voids in isthmus regions and enhancing sealer-dentin interfacial adaptation.",2025-11-10

Radiographically, PO presents as a radiopaque 'halo' over the involved root(s). There is a gap in the literature regarding the prevalence and predisposing factors of PO. This study aims (1) to evaluate the prevalence of PO in maxillary posterior teeth amongst patients at NYU College of Dentistry, Department of Endodontics, and (2) to identify predisposing factors associated with PO. Methodology: A chart review and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) evaluation were conducted at NYU College of Dentistry from 2016 to 2021. Initially, 586 scans were screened, and 335 scans were included. The presence of PO, mucositis, sinus perforation, age, sex, pulpal and periapical diagnosis, size of the lesion, the vertical and horizontal distance between the sinus floor and roots, number of roots with apical lesions, type of tooth, and iatrogenic errors during treatment were recorded. Data were analysed using chi-square, Fisher's tests and logistic regression. Results: Of the 335 CBCT scans included, 98 scans (29.3%) presented with PO. The presence of mucositis was associated with 3.37 times higher odds of PO than those without mucositis. Each incremental increase in the size of the lesion (CBCTPAI) was associated with a 2.51 increase in the odds of PO occurrence, and the vertical distance between the sinus and roots was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The prevalence of PO in this study was higher than previously reported. Three factors were significantly associated with PO: the presence of mucositis, the size of the lesion, and the vertical distance between the sinus and roots.",2025-11-10

Methods: Twenty mandibular premolars were collected, including ten (n = 10) from diabetic patients and ten (n = 10) from healthy controls. Following standardized rotary instrumentation and irrigation protocols, the roots were longitudinally sectioned. Residual stress was assessed using the sin2ψ X-ray diffraction method. Microcracks were visualized under scanning electron microscopy and quantitatively analyzed using a Fiji-based workflow with an AI-assisted comparator. Statistical analyses included independent t tests, Pearson correlation, and linear regression, using two-sided tests with α = 0.05. Results: Significant differences were observed between diabetic and nondiabetic dentin in terms of residual stress (1.40 ± 0.47 MPa vs -1.10 ± 0.44 MPa, P < .001). Microcracks length was greater in diabetic dentin (54.6 ± 9.4 μm) than in nondiabetic controls (20.0 ± 4.6 μm, P < .001), indicating that higher stress levels were associated with longer microcracks. Conclusion: This study found that residual stress contributes to increased microcracks length in instrumented roots, with diabetic dentin showing longer cracks. These findings may explain the higher failure risk in diabetic patients.",2025-11-10

Methods: The shaping ability and irrigant flow patterns in mesial canals of mandibular first molars enlarged with ProTaper Next instruments (25/.06v, 30/.07v, 40/.06v) were evaluated using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Instrument design and metallurgical properties were assessed by 3D scanning, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry to ensure manufacturing consistency. An extracted mandibular molar with two curved mesial root canals was selected and scanned by micro-CT to generate 3D models for CFD simulation. Root canals were prepared stepwise with the ProTaper Next. Digital canal and needle geometries were reconstructed from micro-CT and scanning electron microscopy data. CFD simulations were conducted in ANSYS Fluent to calculate irrigant velocity, wall shear stress, and apical pressure. For shaping analysis, ten mesial canals from 5 mandibular molars were scanned before and after each preparation step. Canal volume, surface area, unprepared surfaces, and pericervical dentine thickness were quantified. Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni correction (P < .05). Results: Excluding for dimensions, all instruments shared similar metallurgical features and design characteristics, with minor surface imperfections. The open-ended needle consistently delivered irrigant to the working length, unlike the side-vented needle. Enlargement slightly increased apical velocity and irrigant density, particularly with the open-ended needle, which also generated higher wall shear stress and apical pressure. Canal volume and surface area increased significantly with larger files (P < .05), while unprepared areas decreased. Progressive canal enlargement significantly reduced minimal dentine thickness at the distal aspect of the mesial canals (most at 1-2 mm below the furcation), dropping from preoperative means of ∼1 mm to 0.60 mm after the 40/.06v instrument (P < .05), with the proportion of sections with dentine <0.5 mm increasing from 0% to 26%, while those >1 mm decreased markedly. Conclusions: Progressive apical enlargement improved shaping and irrigant dynamics, but additional increases offered limited benefits. Irrigant effectiveness was more influenced by needle design than by size alone, suggesting that optimizing delivery systems may enhance cleaning efficiency while minimizing unnecessary dentine removal.",2025-11-10

Methods: Cyclic fatigue tests were conducted using ProTaper Universal (PTU) and ProTaper Gold (PTG) instruments with a curvature of 35° and a radius of 6 mm in both static and dynamic modes at body temperature using a customized cyclic fatigue testing device. The number of cycles to fracture was recorded. A scanning electron microscope was used to examine the fracture surfaces of fractured fragments. Results: The cyclic fatigue resistances of PTU and PTG varied depending on the testing methods (static or dynamic). Statistically significant differences were observed between the 2 file systems, with PTG demonstrating superior fatigue resistance in both testing modes. Notably, dynamic testing resulted in a higher number of cycles to fracture for both PTU and PTG compared to static testing. However, the relative improvement in the cyclic fatigue resistance of PTG over PTU remained consistent under both conditions. The scanning electron microscope analysis of the cross-sectional and longitudinal aspects of the fractured specimens revealed microcrack initiation regions, overloaded quick fracture areas, and microcracks. PTG demonstrated a lower concentration of microcracks compared to PTU. Conclusions: This study confirmed that heat treatment significantly enhances the cyclic fatigue resistance of NiTi instruments and static mode reduces the fatigue resistance of the file. Heat-treated files showed better property due to their martensitic phase, which improves flexibility and reduces crack initiation.",2025-11-10
63a89aa5bf818f3b2dbc818f417d6d9b,The Relationship Between Pulpal Diagnostic Conditions and Potential Inflammatory Biomarkers.,Int Endod J,2025 Sep 9,"Introduction: Accurate diagnosis of pulpal health is crucial to identify the most effective therapeutic approach. However, differentiating pulpal conditions, which may require different treatment approaches, remains a challenge. This study aimed to address this gap by investigating the protein levels of 17 inflammatory biomarkers simultaneously in the dental pulp with different clinical diagnoses. Methods: This study employed a cross-sectional exploratory design, enrolling 64 adult patients. After obtaining ethical approval, researchers conducted clinical and radiographic examinations to categorise teeth into four diagnostic groups: normal pulp, reversible pulpitis, symptomatic irreversible pulpitis and asymptomatic irreversible pulpitis. Pulpal blood samples were then collected and analysed using Luminex technology to measure the levels of inflammatory proteins and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Statistical analyses, including the Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman's rank correlation, were used to compare the levels of these markers across the different diagnoses and to assess their correlation with patient symptoms. Results: The study revealed significant increases in several inflammatory proteins, including IL-4, IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1α, RANTES and MMP-9, in both types of irreversible pulpitis cases compared with other diagnostic categories p < 0.05. These elevated levels exhibited positive correlations with patient-reported pain scores, instances of spontaneous pain and bleeding times. Notably, only IL-4 and IL-7 exhibited correlations with prolonged bleeding times (over 10 min) p < 0.05, while IL-1α and MMP-2 were associated with shorter bleeding times (under 10 min) p < 0.05. Additionally, IL-8 and MCP-1 levels were significantly associated with positive palpation findings p < 0.05, whereas MIP-1α and MMP-1 were correlated with positive percussion results p < 0.05. Conclusion: Differential specific inflammatory potential biomarker levels may differentiate pulpal disease states. Integrating molecular diagnostics into longitudinal clinical trials and eventually into routine endodontic practice, could revolutionise treatment decisions.",2025-11-10
fac5066e632ab5a33603c8a34052ddb8,Clinical Validation of Smartphone-Enabled Pulse Oximetry for Objective Pulp Vitality Assessment: A Diagnostic Accuracy Study.,J Endod,2025 Sep 6:S0099-2399(25)00535-7,"Introduction: Pulse oximetry exhibits great potential for use in endodontic diagnosis as an effective method to assess pulp vitality. Cell phone-integrated oximeters represent an emerging alternative that may offer greater accessibility. This study aimed to investigate the relation between pulp oxygenation rates (%SpO2) and clinical diagnosis of healthy pulp (HP), reversible pulpitis (RP), symptomatic irreversible pulpitis (IP), or pulp necrosis (PN), comparing 2 pulse oximeters (conventional [PO1] and mobile-connected). Methods: Thirty affected premolars were grouped according to the clinical diagnosis of RP, IP, or PN and compared to vitality diagnosis by %SpO2 obtained by both pulse oximeters: PO1 and by smartphone-based (PO2). For each affected tooth, 2 additional teeth (adjacent and contralateral) with HP were tested. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc test. Results: The mean %SpO2 values measured by PO1 were 87.7% for RP, 80.5% for IP, 73.2% for PN, and 91.89% for HP. Corresponding values obtained with PO2 were 85.6% (RP), 79.3% (IP), 72.1% (PN), and 90.1% (HP). Significant differences in %SpO2 were observed among RP, IP, and PN groups (P < .05), but not between healthy control subgroups (adjacent and contralateral). PO1 consistently recorded higher oxygen saturation than PO2 across all clinical conditions (P < .05), demonstrating superior discriminatory capability. Conclusions: Both pulse oximeters demonstrated significant clinical value for pulp vitality assessment and differentiation of pulpal inflammation stages and necrosis. The smartphone-adapted oximeter has proven to be comparable to PO1 in diagnostic performance, while offering data collection efficiency and clinical workflow integration.",2025-11-10
2c2e61d57ce6815434d0dd555986b4dd,Modulation of Prickle2 Expression to Facilitate Dentine Formation: A Laboratory Investigation.,Int Endod J,2025 Sep 7,"Aim: Prickle planar cell polarity (PCP) protein 2 (Prickle2) encodes a homologue of Drosophila prickle and is involved in the non-canonical Wnt/PCP signalling pathway. However, its exact role in dentinogenesis remains unclear. Dentinogenesis, a key process in tooth morphogenesis, involves the patterned arrangement of odontoblasts and the formation of dentine matrix along the pulp cavity. This study investigates the role of PCP signalling, particularly Prickle2, in odontogenesis and dentine formation. Additionally, this study evaluates the potential application of Prickle2 modulation for dentine regeneration using an animal experimental model. Methodology: The developmental function of Prickle2 in tooth morphogenesis was examined by analysing its precise expression pattern in the primary enamel knot. Gain and loss of function studies were performed using in vitro organ cultivation and renal capsule transplantation. At embryonic day 13 (E13), Prickle2 was knocked down using small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) treatment, and histogenesis, cellular physiology (proliferation and apoptosis), and the expression of PCP pathway-related genes and tooth-related signalling molecules were examined. Furthermore, renal capsule transplantation was conducted for 3 weeks to analyse the morphological changes in tooth crown formation. To evaluate the clinical applicability of Prickle2 modulation in dentine regeneration, a pulp exposure animal model was employed, locally administering siRNA against Prickle2 into the exposed pulp cavity of the maxillary first molar at week 8 for 6 weeks. Results: At E13.5, in situ hybridization revealed the distinctive expression of Prickle2 in the enamel knot area. Knockdown of Prickle2 at E13 led to significant alterations in histogenesis and changes in key signalling molecule expression. Renal capsule transplantation resulted in morphological changes, including a thicker pre-dentine layer and the formation of a more opaque crown. In the pulp exposure model, siRNA treatment facilitated the formation of a dentinal bridge compared to controls. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that Prickle2 regulates dentinogenesis through Wnt/PCP signalling. Modulating Prickle2 expression presents a promising approach for dentine regeneration.",2025-11-10
2c5e6dce3b7d2658d28a7944a018c6bc,Redefining Root Canal Shaping: From Size to Volume-The Functional Endodontic Volume Concept.,Int Endod J,2025 Sep 4,"Aim: This article aims to introduce and elaborate on the innovative concept of Functional Endodontic Volume (FEV), a biologically driven approach to root canal shaping. This concept emphasizes the importance of volumetric preparation aimed at enhancing irrigation dynamics during root canal treatment, all while maintaining the tooth's structural integrity. Summary: In recent years, contemporary endodontics has progressively shifted towards methods that prioritize irrigation-based disinfection. Traditional philosophies surrounding canal preparation have predominantly revolved around standardized apical sizes and tapers, often failing to address the true objectives of modern root canal treatment. This article advocates for the FEV concept-a sophisticated and tailored shaping strategy focused on optimizing the efficacy of irrigants used in treatment, promoting mechanical safety, and conserving the structural framework of the tooth. The FEV approach moves beyond merely considering the diameter or taper of the canal; instead, it emphasizes a comprehensive three-dimensional shaping method that is particularly beneficial in anatomically complex root canal systems. By prioritizing the effective exchange of irrigants and the delivery of energy throughout the entire canal volume, this concept not only enhances disinfection but also minimizes the risk of procedural complications. The implications of adopting the FEV concept extend to the clinical and research realms. It can guide the development and refinement of new shaping protocols, the design of endodontic instruments, and the establishment of standardized reporting metrics in endodontic studies. This holistic approach has the potential to revolutionize the way endodontic procedures are performed and assessed. Conclusion: The FEV approach redefines the objectives of canal shaping by concentrating on achieving an effective disinfection-driven canal volume rather than adherence to fixed apical dimensions. It supports a minimally invasive technique that ensures optimal irrigant exchange and agitation, thereby enhancing overall treatment outcomes. The FEV concept could serve as a valuable clinical and research framework, enabling practitioners and researchers to evaluate and compare various shaping systems with a focus on volumetric efficacy.",2025-11-10

Autogenous transplantation was performed using an immature impacted third molar (#28) with compatible root morphology. Despite pulp necrosis requiring root canal treatment at 1 month, functional stability was achieved by 3 months. Three-year follow-up demonstrated complete bone healing, intact periodontal ligament space, and absence of resorption or ankylosis on cone-beam computed tomography.

Thus, this study investigated the impact of sex and age differences on the severity of apical periodontitis (AP) using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and a volumetric periapical index (CBCT-PAI). Methods: CBCT scans of 401 patients (1,027 teeth) were analyzed by calibrated examiners in CBCT-PAI. Chi-square tests were used to assess associations between AP, sex, and age with other variables such as the presence and quality of endodontic treatment and coronal restorations. Robust Poisson regression models were used to evaluate the relationships between dependent and independent variables, with significance set at P < .05. Results: The prevalence of AP was greater in female patients compared to males (66.9% vs 33.1%). Notably, men showed a significantly higher prevalence of larger lesions (CBCT-PAI 4 and 5) than women. Apical periodontitis was more common in root-filled teeth than primary infections, particularly posterior teeth. Lastly, AP was more commonly found in teeth with inadequate root canal fill or coronal restoration, while an intracanal post did not affect its prevalence. Conclusions: AP was more common in women. However, the osteolytic lesions in females were smaller than those seen in males, who demonstrated a greater prevalence of severe lesions. These findings emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and treatment and highlight the significant sexual dimorphism in the pathophysiology of AP.",2025-11-10

Methodology: Primary human dental pulp cells (HDPCs) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and subjected to integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling to map inflammation-associated metabolic shifts. Functional validation included linolenic acid (LA) supplementation (alone or combined with a Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN) inhibitor, TVB-2640), Nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) knockdown, cytokine/NF-κB assessment (ELISA, Western blot), and lipid droplet/FASN visualisation (immunofluorescence). FASN expression was confirmed in vivo (rat pulpitis model). Key findings were verified in clinical pulpitis samples (histology, immunofluorescence, targeted fatty acid profiling). Results: LPS stimulation significantly upregulated FASN expression and induced lipid accumulation in HDPCs and rat pulpitis models (p < 0.001). Transcriptomic analysis revealed marked downregulation of NR4A1, while metabolomic profiling showed depletion of key anti-inflammatory/pro-resolving PUFA precursors, including LA and γ-linolenic acid (GLA). Integrated transcriptomic-metabolomic analysis identified LA as a metabolite with high centrality in the lipid metabolic network, and NR4A1 as a significantly downregulated transcription factor linked to multiple lipid-related pathways. LA supplementation suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, phosphorylated NF-κB p65) and restored NR4A1 expression (p < 0.05). Combining LA with the FASN inhibitor TVB-2640 synergistically enhanced NR4A1 restoration and anti-inflammatory effects (p < 0.001). siRNA-mediated NR4A1 knockdown abolished the benefits of LA. In human pulpitis tissues, FASN upregulation, NR4A1 downregulation, and elevated palmitic acid were observed (p < 0.001), along with increased levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Conclusions: This study reveals a pathological FASN-LA-NR4A1 regulatory axis linking lipid metabolism to inflammatory amplification in pulpitis. Dual targeting of fatty acid synthesis and lipid depletion-through FASN inhibition and LA supplementation-attenuates inflammation via NR4A1-dependent mechanisms. These findings lay the groundwork for metabolic approaches to modulate inflammation in endodontics.",2025-11-10
0881766b7a1a93eb6b894a6a2b28247f,The Cost of Instrument Retrieval on the Root Integrity.,Int Endod J,2025 Sep 2,"Aim: To evaluate dentine loss in mesial canals of mandibular molars following instrument fragment retrieval using two techniques. Methodology: Ten mesial roots of mandibular molars with Type II configuration were selected and scanned in a micro-computed tomography (CT) device. After canal preparation, a 3-mm fragment of a size 35/0.04 rotary instrument was intentionally fractured in the middle third of each mesial canal. In each tooth, one mesial canal was randomly assigned to either ultrasonic retrieval (n = 10) or the combined ultrasonic/lasso technique (n = 10). Removal time was recorded, and pre- and post-retrieval scans were registered to assess changes in dentine thickness, dentine volume, canal volume and cross-sectional area. Data were analysed using Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, Chi-square and Fisher's Exact tests (α = 0.05). Results: All fragments were successfully retrieved. Ultrasonic removal was faster than the combined technique (p = 0.023) but resulted in greater dentine thickness reduction (p = 0.029). No significant differences were observed in canal area increase between groups (p = 0.698). After instrument retrieval, canal volume increased by 23.8%, while dentine volume decreased by 2.2%. Both techniques led to significant reductions in thick dentine regions and increases in thinner regions after preparation and retrieval (p < 0.001), with no significant differences between groups (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Both techniques were effective in retrieving fractured instruments and resulted in similar increases in canal area and volume, as well as comparable proportions of cross-sections exhibiting minimal dentine thickness below 0.5 mm. However, while ultrasonic removal was faster, it caused a greater percentage reduction of dentine thickness compared to the combined ultrasonic/lasso technique.",2025-11-10
760450b9f915bc3868f28fa736934110,Outcome Following Complete and Partial Pulpotomy in Managing Cariously Exposed Mature Permanent Molars With Symptomatic Irreversible Pulpitis: A 5-Year Follow-Up of a Randomised Clinical Trial.,Int Endod J,2025 Sep 2,"Introduction: Numerous studies have reported favourable outcomes following complete pulpotomy (CP) and partial pulpotomy (PP) in cariously exposed mature permanent teeth with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis (SIP) at 1-year follow-up. However, literature on long-term outcomes is sparse. The European Society of Endodontology and the American Association of Endodontists emphasised the need for long-term evidence before establishing pulpotomy as a definitive treatment. This prospective follow-up study aimed to compare 5-year outcomes of CP and PP performed in such teeth. Methodology: This prospective study followed participants from a previously published superiority randomised trial on CP and PP for managing cariously exposed mature permanent teeth with SIP. The original trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04397315). Ninety-three participants (CP-49, PP-44) received the allocated intervention. Of these, 88 (CP-45, PP-43) participants who attended the 1-year follow-up were recalled for the 5-year follow-up. The primary outcome was combined clinical and radiographic success. Secondary outcome measures included hard tissue barrier (HTB) formation and pulp canal obliteration (PCO). Cases were analysed for restoration integrity, secondary caries, periodontal status and pulp sensibility responses. The impact of various prognostic factors on 5-year success was analysed. Outcome measures at 5-year were compared with 1-year outcomes. Statistical tests included the Mann-Whitney U test, chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test, McNemar's test, intention-to-treat analysis and binary logistic regression, with significance set at p < 0.05. Results: At 5 years, 59 of 88 participants (CP-28, PP-31) were available for follow-up. The overall success was 83.05%, with no significant difference between groups (p = 0.494, RR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.88-1.40). While both groups showed comparable evidence of HTB (p = 0.581, RR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.91-1.23), PCO was significantly more evident in the CP group (p = 0.003, RR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.07-0.70). The PP group elicited significantly more sensibility responses to cold test (p = 0.015, RR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.09-7.43). Secondary caries was a significant prognostic factor influencing overall success at 5 years (p < 0.05). No significant differences in success, HTB, or PCO were observed between the 1 and 5 years outcomes in either group (p > 0.05). Conclusions: CP and PP demonstrated comparable success at 5 years. PP may be preferred given its conservative approach, reduced risk of PCO, and more reliable pulp sensibility reoptimizing responses. Adequate restorative seal is crucial for long-term success.

Methods: The canal of human teeth were prepared, sterilized, and inoculated with Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis). Teeth were assigned to 4 groups for 2 rounds of disinfection with Er,Cr: YSGG laser (Biolase). Group I - control, no disinfection, Group II - 6.25% NaOCl, Group III - 1.25% NaOCl, and Group IV - 1.25% NaOCl/NB-H2O. Ca(OH)2 was placed in the canal for ∼10 days between the 2 disinfection rounds. Teeth were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy for biofilm removal and confocal laser scanning microscopy to detect live/dead bacteria in the dentinal tubules. Results: Scanning electron microscopy analysis of the canal disinfection indicated that the NB-H2O group (1.25% NaOCl/NB-H2O) appeared to enhance the removal of biofilm/smear layer. However, it was not consistently more effective than other groups in killing the bacteria in the dentinal tubules. The combined use of low-concentration NaOCl, laser, NB-H2O and Ca(OH)2 largely reduced E. faecalis but did not achieve complete eradication from the canal or in the dentinal tubules. Conclusions: Our comprehensive disinfection protocol reduced the bacteria in the dentinal tubules to a level potentially suited for regenerative endodontic therapy.",2025-11-10

Methods: A 24-year-old female with a history of trauma was referred for treatment of her maxillary anterior tooth. Clinical examination and cone-beam computed tomography imaging revealed that tooth #9 had PIRR with a lateral inflammatory lesion and thin canal walls. Consequently, a novel laser-assisted REPs was performed to treat PIRR. Results: Three-year follow-up showed apical healing, cessation of resorption, and hard tissue formation within the resorptive defect. Conclusions: This outcome demonstrated the efficacy of laser-assisted REPs for managing infection in mature teeth with PIRR, where bleeding from the apical foramen could be supplemented by blood flow through the lateral wall perforations, thereby enhancing the outcome of REPs.",2025-11-10
a141818f850938972659f600c55441e8,Pre-Operative Factors on Prognosis of Regenerative Endodontic Procedures: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Int Endod J,2025 Aug 31,"Background: Although regenerative endodontics has advanced in recent years, the influence of pre-operative factors on treatment outcomes remains poorly understood. Objective: To evaluate the effect of pre-operative factors-including age, gender, tooth type, aetiology of pulp necrosis, stage of root development, clinical signs/symptoms and periradicular status-on the treatment outcomes of regenerative endodontic procedures (REPs) in immature permanent teeth. Methods: A literature search was conducted on six electronic databases and grey literature to identify studies investigating the effect of pre-operative factors on REP outcomes. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies and the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias 2 tool for randomised clinical trials (RCTs). Meta-analyses of proportions were conducted to estimate pooled rates for the outcomes 'clinical and radiographic healing', 'root development' and 'apical closure' across different pre-operative factors. Associations between these factors and treatment outcomes were assessed through meta-analyses of effect sizes. The certainty of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach. Results: Twenty studies were included, comprising 13 observational studies and seven RCTs. Most studies presented a moderate to high risk of bias. The pooled success rate for clinical and radiographic healing exceeded 81% across all pre-operative factors. Moreover, root development was achieved in 52%-95% of cases, whereas complete apical closure ranged from 32% to 91%. No significant association was found between pre-operative factors and clinical and radiographic healing. It was found that teeth with pulp necrosis due to trauma presented 3.59 times higher relative risk of root development failure compared to those with necrosis due to anatomic anomaly (RR = 3.59, 95% CI 1.21-10.67, p = 0.02). Incisors presented 1.90 times higher relative risk of root development failure (RR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.37-2.63, p < 0.01) and 1.98 times higher relative risk of incomplete apical closure (RR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.34-3.13, p = 0.02) compared to premolars. The presence of an apical lesion increased the relative risk of root development failure by 2.55 times (RR = 2.55, 95% CI: 1.63-4.86, p = 0.01). The certainty of evidence was rated as very low. Conclusion: Pre-operative factors were not significantly associated with clinical and radiographic healing in REPs. However, trauma-related pulp necrosis, tooth type (incisors) and the presence of apical lesions were associated with an increased risk of root development failure. These findings should be interpreted with caution due to between-study heterogeneity, the moderate to high risk of bias and the very low certainty of the evidence.",2025-11-10
